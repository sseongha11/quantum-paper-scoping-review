The consequent challenges for future cyber security and strategy require a nuanced analysis of these technologies and their likely employment by major powers. The employment of quantum cryptography can create quantum communications systems that are theoretically unhackable. Within the foreseeable future, quantum computing will be powerful enough to overcome most of today's advanced encryption techniques, rendering the majority of existing commercial, government, and military systems unprecedentedly vulnerable. These quantum technologies could respectively tend to advantage defense and offense in the cyber domain. While the 'shield' enabled by quantum communications would contribute to technological deterrence through denial, the asymmetries of vulnerability that might result could potentially undermine military cyber stability, while exacerbating the risks of misperception through complicating intelligence collection. In the more distant future, the advent of quantum computing will enable unique offensive power that could leapfrog existing cyber capabilities. The strategic impact of these disruptive technologies will depend upon the approaches of great powers, particularly the U.S. and China, which have become leaders in this technological domain. © 2017 IEEE.",Disruptive technology - Distant futures - Encryption technique - Military systems - Quantum Computing - Quantum technologies - Strategic impacts - technological deterrence,Quantum cryptography - Quantum communication - Quantum computers,,,,,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc., United States",,"2017 IEEE International Conference on Cyber Conflict U.S., CyCon U.S. 2017","November 7, 2017 - November 8, 2017","Washington, DC, United states",133550.0,,,,,English,,,, China had achieved a considerable advances in quantum communications and computing.The U.S. has traditionally been at the forefront of advances in quantum information science.

Each protocol has its own advantages, meaning that users can choose the one best-suited to their application, however each often requires different hardware. This complicates multi-user networks, in which users may need multiple transmitters to communicate with one another. Here, we demonstrate a direct-modulation based transmitter that can be used to implement most weak coherent pulse-based QKD protocols with simple changes to the driving signals. This also has the potential to extend to classical communications, providing a low chirp transmitter with simple driving requirements that combines phase shift keying with amplitude shift keying. We perform QKD with concurrent time-bin and phase modulation, alongside phase randomisation. The acquired data is used to evaluate secure key rates for time-bin encoded BB84 with decoy states and a finite key-size analysis, giving megabit per second secure key rates, 1.60 times higher than if purely phase-encoded BB84 was used. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.",quantum communications; quantum cryptography; quantum key distribution,Modulation; Quantum communication; Transmitters; Classical communication; Different protocols; Direct modulation; Intensity-modulated; Multi-user networks; Multiple transmitters; Real-world implementation; Weak coherent pulse; Quantum cryptography,,"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC; Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, (EP/M013472/1)","G L R gratefully acknowledges financial support from the EPSRC CDT in Integrated Photonic and Electronics Systems, Toshiba Research Europe Limited and an industrial fellowship with The Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851.

It arouses much interest recently. In this paper, a novel quantum secure communication protocol is proposed. This is a quasi quantum secure direct communication protocol, since it closely unites the quantum key distribution and the classical communication. In the protocol, a key is distributed between both parties participating in communication using EPR pairs, the secret message is sent through classical public channel and the both are closely combined. The protocol applies a braid-based key agreement protocol to let both parties share a secret random number, whose size and magnitude are undecided in advance. It is used to perform all the authentications of the communication. So the communication is simplified. The security of the proposed protocol is based on the no-cloning theorem and the fact that the p-th root finding problem on braid groups is intractable even on quantum computers, as well as classical computers. © 2010 IEEE.",Bell states; Braid-based key agreement protocol; Information security; Quantum cryptography; Quantum key distribution; Quantum secure direct communication,Authentication; Bells; Cloning; Communication; Computer science; Information technology; Network protocols; Network security; Quantum chemistry; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Quantum theory; Weaving; Bell state; Information security; Key agreement protocol; Quantum key distribution; Quantum secure direct communication; Quantum cryptography,,,,"Bennett C.H., Brassard G., Quantum cryptography: Publickey distribution and coin tossing, Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computers, Systems and Signal Processing, pp. 175-179, (1984); Shor P.W., Preskill J., Simple proof of security of the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol, Phys.

Nowadays, in almost all verticals, such as military, surveillance, industrial Internet of things (IIoT), etc., these vehicles play a vital role. Among these, the SCDVs have a great scope in military applications for border surveillance. They are referred to as the Internet of military vehicles (IoMVs), These vehicles exchange information via an open wireless network, which is highly susceptible to various security and privacy attacks. Existing solutions are based on traditional cryptography (single-layer encryption) and onion routing protocol (multi-layer encryption). Single-layer encryption can be cracked using quantum computing, but in onion routing, every single message is encrypted using a triple layer of encryption (using a single algorithm), which is computationally expensive. These issues can be eliminated using the garlic routing protocol, which sends a bundle of messages together encrypted using two different encryption algorithms. Motivated by this, this paper proposes a garlic routing-based privacy preserving framework for secure data exchange between IoMVs. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated by considering the anonymity rate and bit error rate parameters. The proposed framework has high anonymity rate of 68% and low bit error rates compared to the existing schemes © 2023 IEEE.",5g - Autonomous Vehicles - Garlic routing - Internet of military vehicle - Onion routing - Privacy preserving - Routings - Secure data - Security and privacy - Single layer,5G mobile communication systems - Bit error rate - Electronic data interchange - Military applications - Network security - Privacy-preserving techniques - Routing protocols - Vehicle to vehicle communications,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"2023 IEEE International Conference on Network, Multimedia and Information Technology, NMITCON 2023","September 1, 2023 - September 2, 2023","Bengaluru, India",193544.0,,,,,English,,,,,Engineering Village,,vehicular communication one major outbreak communication make smart connected autonomous vehicle scdvs reality nowadays almost vertical military surveillance industrial internet thing iiot etc vehicle play vital role among scdvs great scope military application border surveillance referred internet military vehicle iomvs vehicle exchange information via open wireless network highly susceptible various security privacy attack existing solution based traditional cryptography singlelayer encryption onion routing protocol multilayer encryption singlelayer encryption cracked using quantum computing onion routing every single message encrypted using triple layer encryption using single algorithm computationally expensive issue eliminated using garlic routing protocol sends bundle message together encrypted using two different encryption algorithm motivated paper proposes garlic routingbased privacy preserving framework secure data exchange iomvs performance proposed framework evaluated considering anonymity rate bit error rate parameter proposed framework high anonymity rate low bit error rate compared existing scheme © ieee,3

However, the exclusivity of quantum channels, the limitation of key generation capabilities, the variety of QKD protocols and the necessity of untrusted-relay selection, make the optimal topology design a very complicated task. In this research, a hybrid QKD network is studied for the first time from the perspective of topology, by analyzing the topological differences of various QKD protocols. In addition, to make full use of hybrid networking, an analytical model for optimal topology calculation is proposed, to reach the goal of best secure communication service by optimizing the deployment of various QKD devices and the selection of untrusted-relays under a given cost limit. Plentiful simulation results show that hybrid networking and untrusted-relay selection can bring great performance advantages, and then the universality and effectiveness of the proposed analytical model are verified. © 2020 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement",,Analytical models; Topology; Communication service; Key generation; Network structures; Optimal topologies; Spatial area; Topological optimization; Topology design; Untrusted relays; article; calculation; simulation; Quantum cryptography,,"Space Science and Technology Advance Research Joint Funds, (6141B06110105); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61301099)",National Natural Science Foundation of China (61301099); Space Science and Technology Advance Research Joint Funds (6141B06110105).,"Elliott C., Colvin A., Pearson D., Pikalo O., Schlafer J., Yeh H., Current status of the darpa quantum network, Quantum Information and computation III, 5815, pp. 138-149, (2005); Poppe A., Peev M., Maurhart O., Outline of the secoqc quantum-key-distribution network in vienna, Int.

Specifically, we address the question whether Bell violation is necessary or sufficient for secure communication. We construct a class of states which do not show Bell violation, however, which can be used for secure communication after local filtering. Similarly, we identify another class of states which show Bell violation but can not be used for generating secure key even after local filtering. The existence of these two classes of states demonstrates that Bell violation as an initial resource is neither necessary nor sufficient for QKD, while it becomes necessary after filtration. Our work therefore forces a departure from traditional thinking that the degree of Bell violation is a key resource for quantum communication and brings out the role of local filtering. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Bell's inequality; CHSH; Local filtering; Quantum key distribution,Quantum communication; Quantum entanglement; Secure communication; Bell violations; Initial resources; Key resources; Local filtering; Quantum key distribution protocols; Quantum cryptography,,"SERB-DST, (ECR/2017/002404); University Grants Committee, UGC","J.S. would like to acknowledge funding from UGC, India.

There are several known transformations that generically turn weakly secure schemes into strongly (i.e., IND-CCA) secure ones. While most of these transformations require the weakly secure scheme to provide perfect correctness, Hofheinz, Hövelmanns, and Kiltz (HHK) (TCC 2017) have recently shown that variants of the Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transform can work with schemes that have negligible correctness error in the (quantum) random oracle model (QROM). Many recent schemes in the NIST post-quantum competition (PQC) use variants of these transformations. Some of their CPA-secure versions even have a non-negligible correctness error and so the techniques of HHK cannot be applied. In this work, we study the setting of generically transforming PKE schemes with potentially large, i.e., non-negligible, correctness error to ones having negligible correctness error. While there have been previous treatments in an asymptotic setting by Dwork et al. (EUROCRYPT 2004), our goal is to come up with practically efficient compilers in a concrete setting and apply them in two different contexts: firstly, we show how to generically transform weakly secure deterministic or randomized PKEs into CCA-secure KEMs in the (Q)ROM using variants of HHK. This applies to essentially all candidates to the NIST PQC based on lattices and codes with non-negligible error, for which we provide an extensive analysis. We thereby show that it improves some of the code-based candidates. Secondly, we study puncturable KEMs in terms of the Bloom Filter KEM (BFKEM) proposed by Derler et al. (EUROCRYPT 2018) which inherently have a non-negligible correctness error. BFKEMs are a building block to construct fully forward-secret zero round-trip time (0-RTT) key-exchange protocols. In particular, we show how to achieve the first post-quantum secure BFKEM generically from lattices and codes by applying our techniques to identity-based encryption (IBE) schemes with (non-)negligible correctness error. © 2020, International Association for Cryptologic Research.",CPA-to-CCA transformations; Fujisaki-Okamoto transform; Non-negligible correctness error; Puncturable encryption,Errors; Public key cryptography; Security of data; Asymptotic setting; Building blockes; Identity based encryption schemes; Key encapsulation mechanisms; Key exchange protocols; Public-key encryption; Random Oracle model; Round-trip time; Quantum cryptography,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (783119, 826610, 871473); Austrian Science Fund, FWF, (P31621-N38)","Acknowledgements.

In this work, we propose a physical layer solution that rely on taking advantage from the inherent physical properties of the channel that marks its imprint on the propagation of the electromagnetic signal through the stochastic atmospheric channel. The proposed architecture would ensure the cybersecurity of a ground station against an MITM attack launched from an aerial platform (AP). As the signal traverses through the channel, various atmospheric effects including thermal noise and tropospheric scintillation fading causes rapid fluctuations in the received signal. The signal at the ground station from a satellite and an AP would traverse different spatial path over the dynamic atmosphere and hence will show different noise like rapid variations at the ground station. These noisy variations are extracted from the received signal using wavelet filtering technique and processed through a deep neural network based on long-short term memory network (LSTM) to identify whether the incoming signal belong to a legitimate satellite or a spoofing AP. We show that an accuracy of more than 98% is achieved in the considered scenario with the proposed network architecture as the altitude of AP changes for launching a machine-in-the-middle (MITM) attack in the line-of-sight direction. © 2022, CC BY.",Aerial platform - Atmospheric effects - Atmospheric noise - Cyber security - Ground stations - LEO satellite - Long-short term memory network - Memory network - Physical layer security - Received signals,Antennas - Cryptography - Deep neural networks - Long short-term memory - Multilayer neural networks - Network architecture - Network security - Orbits - Quantum computers - Satellite links - Satellites - Signal processing,,,,,,,TechRxiv,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Engineering Village,,progress quantum computing would make traditional encryption method easier hack hence next generation communication network include various crosslayer solution ensure cybersecurity network work propose physical layer solution rely taking advantage inherent physical property channel mark imprint propagation electromagnetic signal stochastic atmospheric channel proposed architecture would ensure cybersecurity ground station mitm attack launched aerial platform ap signal traverse channel various atmospheric effect including thermal noise tropospheric scintillation fading cause rapid fluctuation received signal signal ground station satellite ap would traverse different spatial path dynamic atmosphere hence show different noise like rapid variation ground station noisy variation extracted received signal using wavelet filtering technique processed deep neural network based longshort term memory network lstm identify whether incoming signal belong legitimate satellite spoofing ap show accuracy achieved considered scenario proposed network architecture altitude ap change launching machineinthemiddle mitm attack lineofsight direction © cc,7

Although QKD has been widely implemented in many urban fiber networks, the large-scale deployment of QKD remains challenging. Today, researchers extensively conduct simulation-based evaluations for their designs and applications of large-scale QKD networks for cost efficiency. However, the existing discrete-event simulators offer models for QKD hardware and protocols based on sequential event execution, which limits the scale of the experiments. In this work, we explore parallel simulation of QKD networks to address this issue. Our contributions lay in the exploration of QKD network characteristics to be leveraged for parallel simulation as well as the development of a parallel simulation framework for QKD networks. We also investigate three techniques to improve the simulation performance including (1) a ladder queue based event list, (2) memoization for computationally intensive quantum state transformation information, and (3) optimization of the network partition scheme for workload balance. The experimental results show that our parallel simulator is 10 times faster than a sequential simulator when simulating a 128-node QKD network. Our linear-regression-based network partition scheme can further accelerate the simulation experiments up to two times over using a randomized network partition scheme.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",BB84; Parallel discrete-event simulation; Quantum key distribution,Discrete event simulation; Quantum theory; Simulators; Bb84; Design and application; Fiber networks; Large-scale deployment; Large-scales; Network partitions; Network testbeds; Parallel discrete-event simulation; Parallel simulations; Partition schemes; Quantum cryptography,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (CNS-1730488, DMR-1747426); Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR, (YIP FA9550-17-1-0240)","D.

It requires software engineers and developers to consider a new level of socio-technical interaction and planning. Software should not be the point of friction among products, services and users, but should rather encourage software engineers and developers to become more human-oriented. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the future of work skills in Society 5.0 for software engineers and developers. We collected and analyzed two datasets; one dataset containing academic peer reviewed publications and the second dataset encompassed popular press articles that predicted the future of software engineering and development. We used the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) to map the data and found that future of work skills for software engineers and developers are driven by software foundations and the evolution of new programming languages and technologies e.g. quantum computing. In addition, software professional practices such as containerization, no / low-code development and fast innovation / prototyping cycles will affect the future of work together with software development practices such as cross-platform development, continuous integration and deployment, and cybersecurity. Based on the findings, we developed a skills evaluation tool that could be used to establish a future of work skills profile. By considering the evolution of the software engineering and –development role, as well as the future requirement due to technology evolution, a software engineer and developer may be able to prepare themselves for the Society 5.0 domain. © 2022, EasyChair.

Current cryptographic mechanisms, especially RSA and ECC, are susceptible to quantum breaches due to their reliance on factorization and discrete logarithm problems. The emergence of quantum computers endangers traditional cryptographic infrastructures, exposing them to swift decryption by algorithms like Shor’s, N = p · q, N and Grover’s, r = a2 mod N, where N is the product of two significant primes, p and q, and r denotes the remainder after applying Grover’s algorithm to a. Conventional cryptographic methods, which rest on problems solvable by quantum computers, emphasize the need to transition to PQC, substituting prevalent methods with quantum-resilient alternatives, represented by E = me mod n, where E is the encrypted message, m the plaintext, e the public key exponent, and n the product of two prime numbers. This research evaluates the efficacy of PQC approaches, encompassing lattice-based, code-based, and isogeny-based cryptography, with assessments based on metrics like encryption duration, Te =f1e, and key length, log2(N), where Te represents encryption time and fe the encryption speed. Employing standardized datasets, we examine encryption and decryption speeds, key sizes, and success metrics against NIST’s endorsed security standards. The findings underscore PQC’s potential in delivering robust security, albeit with variations in performance metrics, guiding secure communication choices. In summation, the study highlights the essential shift to PQC in addressing the vulnerabilities ushered in by quantum computing, presenting a spectrum of fortified strategies for the future of information security. © 2023 IEEE.",cryptographic methods;

The central building block for these applications is a quantum emitter (QE), a controllable source of single photons or photon pairs. Semiconductor QEs such as perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) and semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have been demonstrated to be a promising material for pure single-photon emission, and their hybrids with plasmonic nanocavities may serve as sources of photon pairs. Here we have designed a system in which individual quantum emitters and their ensembles can be traced before, during, and after the interaction with the external plasmonic metasurface in controllable way. Upon coupling the external plasmonic metasurface to the array of QEs, the individual QEs switch from single-photon to photon-pair emission mode. Remarkably, this method does not affect the chemical structure and composition of the QEs, allowing them to return to their initial state after decoupling from the plasmonic metasurface. By employing this approach, we have successfully demonstrated the reversible switching of the ensemble of individual semiconductor QEs between single-photon and photon pair emission modes. This significantly broadens the potential applications of semiconductor QEs in quantum technologies. © 2023, CC BY-NC-ND.",Biexcitons - Emission modes - Metasurface - Perovskite nanocrystal - Photon pairs - Plasmonics - Purcell-effect - Quantum dot - Quantum emitters - Single photons,Particle beams - Perovskite - Photons - Plasmonics - Quantum communication - Quantum optics - Semiconductor quantum dots,,,,,,,arXiv,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Engineering Village,,field quantum technology rapidly expanding past decade yielding numerous application quantum information quantum communication quantum cybersecurity central building block application quantum emitter qe controllable source single photon photon pair semiconductor qes perovskite nanocrystals pncs semiconductor quantum dot qds demonstrated promising material pure singlephoton emission hybrid plasmonic nanocavities may serve source photon pair designed system individual quantum emitter ensemble traced interaction external plasmonic metasurface controllable way upon coupling external plasmonic metasurface array qes individual qes switch singlephoton photonpair emission mode remarkably method affect chemical structure composition qes allowing return initial state decoupling plasmonic metasurface employing approach successfully demonstrated reversible switching ensemble individual semiconductor qes singlephoton photon pair emission mode significantly broadens potential application semiconductor qes quantum technology © cc byncnd,12

However, what if there is gold in that garbage? In conventional engineering, our focus is primarily on eliminating, suppressing, combating, or even ignoring noise and its detrimental impacts. Conversely, could we exploit it similarly to biology, which utilizes noise-alike carrier signals to convey information? In this context, the utilization of noise, or noise-alike signals in general, has been put forward as a means to realize unconditionally secure communication systems in the future. In this tutorial article, we begin by tracing the origins of thermal noise-based communication and highlighting one of its significant applications for ensuring unconditionally secure networks: the Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise (KLJN) secure key exchange scheme. We then delve into the inherent challenges tied to secure communication and discuss the imperative need for physics-based key distribution schemes in pursuit of unconditional security. Concurrently, we provide a concise overview of quantum key distribution (QKD) schemes and draw comparisons with their KLJN-based counterparts. Finally, extending beyond wired communication loops, we explore the transmission of noise signals over-the-air and evaluate their potential for stealth and secure wireless communication systems. © 2023, CC BY.",Johnson noise - Key distribution - Kirchhoff laws - Kirchhoff-law-johnson-noise scheme - Noise modulation - Quantum key distribution - Thermal noise communication - Thermal noise modulation - Unconditional security - Unconditionally secure communications,Network security - Quantum cryptography - Secure communication,,,,,,,arXiv,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Engineering Village,,noise enemy dealt major factor limiting communication system performance however gold garbage conventional engineering focus primarily eliminating suppressing combating even ignoring noise detrimental impact conversely could exploit similarly biology utilizes noisealike carrier signal convey information context utilization noise noisealike signal general put forward mean realize unconditionally secure communication system future tutorial article begin tracing origin thermal noisebased communication highlighting one significant application ensuring unconditionally secure network kirchhofflawjohnsonnoise kljn secure key exchange scheme delve inherent challenge tied secure communication discus imperative need physicsbased key distribution scheme pursuit unconditional security concurrently provide concise overview quantum key distribution qkd scheme draw comparison kljnbased counterpart finally extending beyond wired communication loop explore transmission noise signal overtheair evaluate potential stealth secure wireless communication system © cc,13

An important part of QKD technology is a high-quality random number generator for the quantum-state preparation and for post-processing procedures. In this work, we consider a class of prepare-and-measure QKD protocols, utilizing additional pseudorandomness in the preparation of quantum states. We study one of such protocols and analyze its security against the intercept-resend attack. We demonstrate that, for single-photon sources, the considered protocol gives better secret key rates than the BB84 and the asymmetric BB84 protocols.

A new multi-hop teleportation scheme is investigated for transferring arbitrary unknown multi-qudit states between two distant parties. Based on a more general quantum routing protocol, intermediate nodes are introduced and linked with each other via d-level entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states as quantum channels. In this multi-hop teleportation protocol, the source node and all the intermediate nodes can perform the entanglement measurement and transmit the measurement results simultaneously, thus reducing the time consumption largely. Furthermore, a general matrix formula is derived between the measurement results and the receiver's state, which enables the receiver to restore the unknown state efficiently. Compared with previous multi-hop teleportation protocols, the teleportation protocol of arbitrary unknown multi-qudit states of the authors can transfer more information, and it demonstrates lower computational complexity and higher flexibility. © 2023 The Authors.

These applications such as delegated quantum computation require running a secure identification protocol between a low-resource and a high-resource party to provide secure communication. In this work, we propose two identification protocols based on the emerging hardware-secure solutions, the quantum Physical Unclonable Functions (qPUFs). The first protocol allows a low-resource party to prove its identity to a high-resource party and in the second protocol, it is vice versa. Unlike existing identification protocols based on Quantum Read-out PUFs that rely on the security against a specific family of attacks, our protocols provide provable exponential security against any Quantum Polynomial-Time adversary with resource-efficient parties. We provide a comprehensive comparison between the two proposed protocols in terms of resources such as quantum memory and computing ability required in both parties as well as the communication overhead between them.  © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",entity authentication; hardware security; Identification; network protocols; quantum cryptography,Computer hardware; Hardware security; Network security; Polynomial approximation; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Client /server; Comprehensive comparisons; Entity authentications; Exponentials; Identification; Identification protocol; Polynomial-time; Quantum Computing; Quantum memory; Resource-efficient; Network protocols,,,,"Quantum Protocol Zoo, (2019); Alagic G., Majenz C., Quantum non-malleability and authentication, Annual International Cryptology Conference, pp. 310-341, (2017); Alagic G., Majenz C., Russell A., Efcient simulation of random states and random unitaries, Annual International Conference on the Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques, pp. 759-787, (2020); Arapinis M., Delavar M., Doosti M., Kashef E., Quantum physical unclonable functions: Possibilities and impossibilities, Quantum, 5, (2021); Armknecht F., Moriyama D., Sadeghi A.-R., Yung M., Towards a unifed security model for physically unclonable functions, Cryptographers' Track at the Rsa Conference, pp. 271-287, (2016); Arute F., Arya K., Babbush R., Bacon D., Bardin J.C., Barends R., Biswas R., Boixo S., Brandao F.G.S.L., Buell D.A., Et al., Quantum supremacy using a programmable superconducting processor, Nature, 574, 7779, pp. 505-510, (2019); Barenco A., Berthiaume A., Deutsch D., Ekert A., Jozsa R., MacChiavello C., Stabilization of quantum computations by symmetrization, Siam J.

For such limited coverage area, IEEE 802.11 standard may be observed as building-oriented environment, which potentially offers a chance to let quantum key distribution (QKD) play a role in the security of wireless communications. In fact, secured data transmission is one of the prime aspects of wireless networks as they are much more vulnerable to security attacks. In this paper, we explore the possibility of using an agent-oriented Quantum Key Distribution for authentication and data encryption for IEEE 802.11 standard based on our previous research. It will focus on some basic concept that how QKD merges the wireless communication, in particular the IEEE 802.11 standard. The software implementation of the first two phases of QKD, namely (a) raw key extraction and (b) error estimation, will be carefully investigated in this paper.

Researchers have shown immense interest in emerging quantum computing (QC) due to its potentials of solving the computing complexity in the robust and efficient manner. It is envisioned that QC can act as critical enablers and strong catalysts to considerably reduce the computing complexities and boost the future of sixth generation (6G) and beyond communication systems in terms of their security. In this study, the fundamentals of QC, the evolution of quantum communication that encompasses a wide spectrum of technologies and applications and quantum key distribution, which is one of the most promising applications of quantum security, have been presented. Furthermore, various parameters and important techniques are also investigated to optimise the performance of 6G communication in terms of their security, computing, and communication efficiency. Towards the end, potential challenges that QC and quantum communication may face in 6G have been highlighted along with future directions. © 2023 The Authors.

Coherent quantum light generation at telecom wavelengths is fundamental for fibre-based network implementations, but Fourier-limited emission and subnatural linewidth photons have so far only been reported from systems operating in the visible to near-infrared wavelength range. Here, we use InAs/InP quantum dots to demonstrate photons with coherence times much longer than the Fourier limit at telecom wavelength via elastic scattering of excitation laser photons. Further, we show that even the inelastically scattered photons have coherence times within the error bars of the Fourier limit. Finally, we make direct use of the minimal attenuation in fibre for these photons by measuring two-photon interference after 25 km of fibre, demonstrating finite interference visibility for photons emitted about 100,000 excitation cycles apart. © 2023, The Author(s).",,quantum dot; zirconium oxide; light scattering; quantum mechanics; visibility; wavelength; absorption spectroscopy; adaptation; Article; attenuation; autocorrelation; controlled study; deconvolution; dipole; elasticity; excitation; Fourier transform; immersion; interferometry; light scattering; measurement; oscillation; photoluminescence; photon; telecommunication; theoretical model; visibility; article; laser; photon,"zirconium oxide, 1314-23-4, 53801-45-9","Toshiba Europe Limited; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC; University of Sheffield; Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, MIC","Funding text 1: The authors gratefully acknowledge the usage of wafer material developed during earlier projects in partnership with Andrey Krysa and Jon Heffernan at the National Epitaxy Facility and at the University of Sheffield.

Efficient and secure data transfer among sensors and IoT devices is a major challenge. To address this, the manuscript presents coherent manipulation of the scattering cross section and its sensitivity based on subluminal propagation and rotary photon drag, using an atomic medium with two levels coupled with a cavity. The group index of the proposed atomic medium is measured in the range of - 0.1 ≤ ng≤ 150 and group velocity in the range of 2 × 10 6m/ s≤ vg≤ ± 2 × 10 9 m/s. The maximum delay time is reported to tg= 0.3 μs and rotary photon drag to θd= ± 5 micro radian. This effect of photon drag is used in sensing, energy harvesting, and optical switching in IoT. The scattering cross-section of 0.1 × 10 21m2 is reported. The scattering cross-section impacts the efficiency and reliability of quantum-based communication for IoT. The maximum cross-sectional sensitivity is measured to Sσ= 0.4 × 10 - 19m2/ nr . The cross-sectional sensitivity potentially impacts secure communication and highly precise detection in sensors and IoT. © 2023, The Author(s).",Quantum Effects; Quantum for Internet of Things; Quantum Technology; Quantum-based Sensors,Atoms; Coherent scattering; Data transfer; Drag; Energy harvesting; Photons; Quantum cryptography; Slow light; Atomic media; Photon drags; Quantum effects; Quantum for internet of thing; Quantum technologies; Quantum-based sensor; Scattering cross section; Secure data transfer; Secure modeling; Slow-light propagation; Internet of things,,"Taif University, TU; Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University","The researchers would like to acknowledge the Deanship of Scientific Research, Taif University for funding this work.

In data sharing, for assuring security, the data are secured with key and the key is required to be encrypted to keep that not accessible for attacks. With that concern, this work develops a Quantum Cryptography based Cloud Security Model (QC-CSM) that uses Quantum Key Distribution Protocol (QKDP) for sharing the secret key between parties. For ensuring the data owner about the security of their share data over Cloud, Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) is used. Further, the data can be accessed by an authenticated user, who is having the access for decryption through the key from a secure quantum channel. The results show that the proposed model outperforms the existing works by providing a more secure environment and confidential data sharing between entities in minimal time in the Cloud framework. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Attribute Based Encryption (ABE); Confidentiality; Data Encryption; Data security; Quantum Key Distribution Protocol (QKDP); Secure key,Authentication; Cloud storage; Quantum cryptography; Attribute based encryption; Attribute-based encryptions; Cloud securities; Confidentiality; Data encryption; Data Sharing; Quantum key distribution protocol; Quantum-key- distribution protocol; Secure key; Security modeling; Cloud security,,,,"Alan M., Sheila F., Ray P., Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Commodity Security Protocols: Introduction and Integration, Int J Netw Secur Appl, 1, 2, pp. 1-12, (2009); Avesani M., Tebyanian H., Villoresi P., Vallone G., Semi-device-independent heterodyne-based quantum random number generator, Phys Rev Appl, 15, (2020); Ayad F., Barsoum, Anwar Hasan M (2012) “Integrity Verification of Multiple Data Copies over Untrusted Cloud Servers,” In the Proceedings of 12th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGRID, pp. 829-834, (2012); Bennett C.H., Brassard G., C.

With quantum cryptography, neither the transmitter nor the receiver of the message can be tricked into compromising the system's security. It has gained more attention recently and has emerged as one of the most promising areas of cryptography for quicker, more efficient, and more secure communication. However, compared to what the finest quantum computers of today have achieved, breaking quantum computers in the future will require 100,000 times more processing power and a 100 times lower error rate. While it seems like quantum computing (QCom) has the ability to dramatically change a number of industries, cybersecurity is one that is put in jeopardy by its arrival. It is possible that Qcom (QCom) will make conventional cryptography methods useless. We still don't fully understand the harmful implications of cybersecurity. Unfortunately, Qcom can influence cybersecurity in a few specific areas. When beginning to plan for quantum safety, IT strategists should take the cybersecurity implications of Qcom into account. Their long-term cybersecurity plan must include making sensitive data, risk management practises, identity management systems, and linked technologies quantum secure. © 2023 Scrivener Publishing LLC.",Cryptanalysis; Device-independent cryptography; Quantum hacking; Quantum internet; Quantum key distribution,,,,,"Grasselli F., Quantum cryptography, Quantum science and technology, (2021); Bakan G., Ayas S., Serhatlioglu M., Dana A., Elbuken C., Modular metamaterials enable reversible decryption of hidden nanometer-thick patterns, Optics Letters, 44, 18, pp. 4507-4510, (2019); Sniatala P., Iyengar S., Ramani S.K., Symmetric Key Cryptography, Evolution of Smart Sensing Ecosystems with Tamper Evident Security, (2021); Applebaum B., Barak B., Wigderson A., Various public-key cryptography presumptions, Proceedings of the Forty-second ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, pp. 171-180, (2010); Pawar H.R., Harkut D.G., Classical and Quantum Cryptography for Image Encryption & Decryption, 2018 International Conference on Research in Intelligent and Computing in Engineering (RICE), pp. 1-4, (2018); Keplinger K., Is quantum computing becoming relevant to cybersecurity?, Network Security, 2018, 9, pp. 16-19, (2018); Mosca M., Will we be prepared for cybersecurity in the age of quantum computers?, IEEE Security & Privacy, 16, 5, pp. 38-41, (2018); Nahed M., Alawneh S., Cybersecurity in a post-quantum world: How quantum computing will forever change the world of cybersecurity, American Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 4, 2, pp. 81-93, (2020); Vaishnavi A., Pillai S., Study of Perceived Risks in Conventional Cryptography in the Quantum Era and Discussion of Post Quantum Methods, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1964, 4, (2021); Menard A., Ostojic I., Patel M., Volz D., A game plan for quantum computing, McKinsey Quarterly, (2020); Vaishnavi A., Pillai S., Cybersecurity in the Quantum Era-A Study of Perceived Risks in Conventional Cryptography and Discussion on Post Quantum Methods, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1964, 4, (2021); Hwang W.-Y., Matsumoto K., Imai H., Kim J., Lee H.-W., Shor-Preskill-type security proof for concatenated Bennett-Brassard 1984 quantum-key-distribution protocol, Physical Review A, 67, 2, (2003); Wang Y., Wang H., Li Z., Huang J., Man-in-the-middle attack on BB84 protocol and its defence, 2009 2nd IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology, Beijing, pp. 438-439, (2009); Vaishnavi A., Pillai S., Cybersecurity in the Quantum Era-A Study of Perceived Risks in Conventional Cryptography and Discussion on Post Quantum Methods, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1964, 4, (2021); Srivastava S., Tiwari A., Srivastava P.K., Review on quantum safe algorithms based on Symmetric Key and Asymmetric Key Encryption methods, 2022 2nd International Conference on Advance Computing and Innovative Technologies in Engineering (ICACITE), pp. 905-908, (2022); Patgiri R., PrivateDH: An Enhanced Diffie-Hellman Key-Exchange Protocol using RSA and AES Algorithm, Cryptology ePrint Archive, (2021); Rajput V.S., Keller J.M., Mor P., Secure Cryptography with ngDH protocol along with RSA & AES Algorithm, (2022); Badhwar R., The need for post-quantum cryptography, The CISO's Next Frontier, (2021); Gheorghiu V., Mosca M., A Resource Estimation Framework for Quantum Attacks Against Cryptographic Functions: Recent Developments, (2021); Ketti R., Bhatia V., A quantum safe cryptographic algorithm using polynomial interpolations, AIP Conference Proceedings, 2357, 1, (2022)","A.

We present a technique to monitor second-order photon correlation g ( 2 ) ( 0 ) of amplified quantum noise based on wideband balanced homodyne detection and deep-learning acceleration. The quantum noise is effectively amplified by an injection of weak chaotic laser, and the g ( 2 ) ( 0 ) of the amplified quantum noise is measured with a real-time sample rate of 1.4 GHz. We also exploit a photon correlation convolutional neural network accelerating correlation data using a few quadrature fluctuations to perform a parallel processing of g ( 2 ) ( 0 ) for various chaos injection intensities and effective bandwidths. The deep-learning method accelerates the g ( 2 ) ( 0 ) experimental acquisition with a high accuracy, estimating 6107 sets of photon correlation data with a mean square error of 0.002 in 22 s and achieving a three orders of magnitude acceleration in the data acquisition time.

Strong cryptographic methods are now essential given the rising reliance on digital technologies and the threats posed by bad actors. This abstract examines the evolution of secure communication protocols and data protection techniques as it relates to the advancements in cryptography. The development of post-quantum cryptography is the most notable development in cryptography discussed in this study. As quantum computers become more powerful, they pose a serious threat to traditional cryptographic algorithms, such as RSA and ECC. Designing algorithms that are immune to attacks from quantum computers is the goal of post-quantum cryptography.

Neural cryptography offers a potential alternative that is resistant to attacks of known quantum computer algorithms. The considered solution is lightweight and computationally efficient. If a quantum computer algorithm were successfully implemented, it could expose IoT sensors and smart grid components to a wide range of attack vectors. Given the lightweight nature of neural cryptography and the potential risks, neural cryptography could have potential applications in both IoT sensors and smart grid systems. This paper evaluates one of the suggested enhancements: the use of integer-valued input vectors that accelerate the synchronization of the Tree Parity Machine. This enhancement introduces a new parameter M that indicates the minimum and maximum values of input vector elements. This study evaluates the nonbinary version of the mutual learning algorithm in a simulated insecure environment. The results indicate that, while the Nonbinary Tree Parity Machine may involve some trade-offs between security and synchronization time, the speed improvement is more substantial than the decrease in security. The impact of this enhancement is particularly significant for smaller adjustments to parameter M. © 2023 by the authors.",cybersecurity; key agreement; mutual learning; neural networks; smart grids,Cryptography; Cybersecurity; Economic and social effects; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Network protocols; Network security; Neural networks; Quantum computers; Cyber security; Input vector; Key agreement; Mutual learning; Neural Cryptography; Neural-networks; Quanta computers; Sensor grids; Smart grid; Tree parity machine; Smart power grids,,AGH University of Krakow,Research project partly supported by the program “Excellence initiative—research university” for the AGH University of Krakow.,"Niemiec M., Dziech A., Stypinski M., Derkacz J., Quantum-Based Solutions for the Next-Generation Internet, Inf.

The project was conducted on currently available IBM quantum systems using the Qiskit development kit. This work extends previously reported implementation of QPP used to encrypt basis states and demonstrates that application of the QPP scheme is not limited to the encryption of basis states. For this implementation, a pad of 56 2-qubit Permutation matrices was used, providing 256 bits of entropy for the QPP algorithm. An image of a cat was used as the plaintext for this experiment. The plaintext was randomized using a classical XOR function prior to the state preparation procedure. To create corresponding superposition states, we applied a novel operator defined in this paper. These superposition states were then encrypted using QPP, with 2-qubit Permutation Operators, producing superposition ciphertext states. Due to the lack of a quantum channel, we omitted the transmission and executed the decryption procedure on the same IBM quantum system. If a quantum channel existed, the superposition ciphertext states could be transmitted as qubits, and be directly decrypted on a different quantum system. We provide a brief discussion of the security, although the focus of the paper remains on the implementation. Previously we have demonstrated QPP operating in both classical and quantum computers, offering an interesting opportunity to bridge the security gap between classical and quantum systems. This work broadens the applicability of QPP for the encryption of basis states as well as superposition states. We believe that quantum encryption schemes that are not limited to basis states will be integral to a secure quantum internet, to reduce vulnerabilities introduced by using two separate algorithms for secure communication between a quantum and a classical computer. © 2023, The Author(s).",IBM Quantum; Qiskit; QKD; QPP; Quantum Circuits; Quantum Communication; Quantum Cryptography; Quantum Encryption; Quantum Information; Quantum-safe Communication; Superposition states; Symmetric cryptography; Symmetric encryption,Communication channels (information theory); Quantum channel; Quantum cryptography; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Qubits; Security of data; Timing circuits; IBM quantum; Qiskit; QKD; Quantum circuit; Quantum encryption; Quantum Information; Quantum permutation pad; Quantum-safe communication; Safe communications; Superposition state; Symmetric cryptography; Symmetric encryption; Quantum communication,,"Quantropi Inc., (ON K1Z 8P9); International Business Machines Corporation, IBM","Authors acknowledge IBM for their free of charge 5-qubit quantum computers used for this study.

In this work, a practical, scalable, verifiable (k, n) threshold continuous variable QSS protocol secure against eavesdroppers and dishonest players are proposed and demonstrated. The protocol does not require preparing the laser source by each player and phase locking of independent lasers. The parameter evaluation and key extraction can be accomplished by only the dealer and the corresponding player. By using the multiple sideband modulation, a single heterodyne detector can extract the information of multiple players. The practical security of the system is considered. The system is versatile, it can support the CKA protocol by only modifying the classic post-processing and requiring no changes to the underlying hardware architecture. By implementing the QSS and CKA protocols with five parties over 25 km (55 km) single-mode fibers, a key rate of 0.0061 (7.14 × 10−4) bits per pulse is observed. The results significantly reduces the system complexity and paves the way for the practical applications of QSS and CKA with efficient utilization of resources and telecom technologies. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.",,Locks (fasteners); Network architecture; Network security; Quantum cryptography; Conference key agreement; Continuous variables; Experimental demonstrations; Key agreement protocol; Laser sources; Multiparty quantum secret sharing; Phase-locking; Quantum network; Quantum secret sharing; Secret sharing protocols; Single mode fibers,,"Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology, (2021ZD0300703); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (1331KSC, 62175138, 62205188)","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (62175138, 62205188); Shanxi 1331KSC; Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology (2021ZD0300703).

Although implementations exist both in fiber and in free space, the latter approach is often considered challenging due to environmental factors. Here, we implement a quantum communication protocol during daytime for the first time using a quantum dot source. This technology presents advantages in terms of narrower spectral bandwidth—beneficial for filtering out sunlight—and negligible multiphoton emission at peak brightness. We demonstrate continuous operation over the course of three days, across an urban 270 m-long free-space optical link, under different light and weather conditions. © 2023 The Author(s).

Many QKD protocols have been proposed and demonstrated to ensure secure communication between two authenticated users. Continuous variable (CV) QKD offers many advantages over discrete variable (DV) QKD since it is cost-effective, compatible with current classical communication technologies, efficient even in daylight, and gives a higher secure key rate. Keeping this in view, we demonstrate a discrete modulated CVQKD protocol in the free space which is robust against polarization drift. We also present the simulation results with a noise model to account for the channel noise and the effects of various parameter changes on the secure key rate. These simulation results help us to verify the experimental values obtained for the implemented CVQKD. © 2023 The Authors",Continuous variable; Homodyne detection; Quantum communication; Quantum key distribution,,,"Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी","We thank Dr. Rajesh Kumar Kushawaha for providing the resources required for the experiment.

Traditional cryptography often relies on complex mathematical problems for encryption, such as difficult decompositions or extracting discrete logarithms. With the development of quantum computing, the security of these classical encryption methods is under threat. To address this challenge, quantum E-payment protocols have emerged as a potential solution. However, the practical quantum E-payment protocols are limited due to the channel transmission efficiency decreasing exponentially with distance. This is further constrained by the Pirandola–Laurenza–Ottaviani–Banchi (PLOB) bound. To address this challenge, we propose a twin-field quantum encryption protocol for E-payment based on blockchain. In our protocol, we propose a twin-field quantum encryption method to authenticate identity and detect eavesdropping simultaneously. It not only eliminates side-channel attacks on the detectors but also has the potential to break the PLOB bound. Our security analysis shows that our E-payment protocol exhibits security properties such as blindness, unforgeability, and undeniability. Furthermore, our protocol demonstrates withstand against common inside and outside attacks. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Blockchain; E-payment; Quantum identity authentication; Twin-field quantum,Blockchain; Electronic money; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Side channel attack; Block-chain; Electronic payment; Electronic payment protocols; Electronic payment systems; Encryption methods; Encryption protocols; Mathematical problems; Quantum encryption; Quantum identity authentication; Twin-field quantum; Authentication,,"Open Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology; Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, BUPT","We would like to thank the anonymous referees for their helpful comments.

Initially distinguished by high levels of international scientific cooperation, a 'quantum race' is heating up across multiple sectors and between major powers, who recognise that technological prowess will be a key determinant of geostrategic, as well as economic supremacy in the 21st century. Quantum is seen as a critical emerging technology in this rivalry, with the potential for full-spectrum applications in warfare, including quantum computers that enhance the capabilities of AI and machine learning, improve the performance of lethal autonomous weapons systems and increase the capacity for analysing large datasets; quantum algorithms that break classical encryption while quantum networks provide completely secure communications; and quantum sensors that provide more sensitive detection, measurement and control of the physical environment. In a densely networked, information-saturated battlespace requiring accelerated decision-making, quantum computers, communications, control and artificial intelligence (QC3AI) has the potential to further reduce the human element in future warfare. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Artur Gruszczak and Sebastian Kaempf.

For practical deployment, such systems are desired to be overlaid onto existing wavelength-multiplexing transmission systems, without using a dedicated transmission line. This study analytically investigates the feasibility of the intensity-modulation/ direction-detection (IM/DD) SKD scheme being wavelength-multiplexed with conventional wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) signals, concerning spontaneous Raman scattering light from conventional optical signals. Simulation results indicate that IM/DD SKD systems are not degraded when they are overlaid onto practically deployed dense WDM transmission systems in the C-band, owing to the feature of the IM/DD SKD scheme, which uses a signal light with an intensity level comparable to conventional optical signals unlike conventional quantum key distribution schemes. © 2023 Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication, Engineers, IEICE.

In modern society, cryptography is widely used; everything from personal life to national security is inseparable from it. With the emergence of quantum computing, traditional encryption methods are at risk of being cracked. People are beginning to explore methods for defending against quantum computer attacks. Among the methods currently developed, quantum key distribution is a technology that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to distribute keys. Post-quantum encryption algorithms are encryption methods that rely on mathematical challenges that quantum computers cannot solve quickly to ensure security. In this study, an integrated review of post-quantum encryption algorithms is conducted from the perspective of traditional cryptography. First, the concept and development background of post-quantum encryption are introduced. Then, the post-quantum encryption algorithm Kyber is studied. Finally, the achievements, difficulties and outstanding problems in this emerging field are summarized, and some predictions for the future are made. © 2023 by the authors.",cryptography; CRYSTALS-KYBER; post-quantum encryption; quantum computing; quantum security,Chromium compounds; Crystals; National security; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; CRYSTALS-KYBER; Encryption methods; Post quantum; Post-quantum encryption; Post-quantum securities; Quanta computers; Quantum Computing; Quantum encryption; Quantum encryption algorithm; Quantum security; algorithm; confidentiality; encryption; human; national security; prediction; quantum mechanics; review; security; Quantum cryptography,,,,"Xu F., Ma X., Zhang Q., Lo H.K., Pan J.W., Secure quantum key distribution with realistic devices, Rev.

The quantum mainly executes and expected to get out of discrete logarithmic for them such as AES, RSA, DES. The quantum real key distribution is the key process which would be divided b/w only 2 people known as cryptographic strategies. Information of all security now has the most crucial procedure for gathering and exchanging due to the unique understanding of data diffusion in network surroundings and increase the attackers' possibilities. In contrast, to convey this security information, secure encryption techniques will be used to authorise the secrecy, data integrity, and data origin authentication.

Security and fidelity of intranetwork communication between quantum devices is the backbone of a quantum network. This work presents an protocol that generates entanglement between any two directly connected nodes of a quantum network to be used as a resource to enable quantum communication across that pair in the network. The protocol is based on a directed discrete-time quantum walk and paves the way for private inter-node quantum communication channels in the network. We also present the simulation results of this protocol on random networks generated from various models. We show that after implementation, the probability of the walker being at all nodes other than the source and target is negligible and this holds independent of the random graph generation model. This constitutes a viable method for the practical realisation of secure communication over any random network topology. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.",quantum algorithm; quantum communication; quantum network; quantum walk,Graph theory; Internet protocols; Network security; Quantum cryptography; Secure communication; Conventional approach; Cryptographic resources; Discrete time; Intranetworks; Quantum algorithms; Quantum device; Quantum network; Quantum walk; Random network; Time quantum; Quantum communication,,"Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, DST, (DST/ICPS/QuST/Theme-1/2019)","P C would like to thank Tanmay Saha for the insightful discussions.

With such growth in Smart Cities, data volume and diversity increase due to Internet of Things (IoT) sensors in devices. However, this abundance of data exposes millions of vulnerable devices to cyber threats, risking compromised security and sensitive information. To address these risks, Smart Cities utilize Intelligent Operations Centers (IOCs) equipped with Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. These algorithms continuously monitor and protect against security incidents. Although Quantum Computing (QC) has shown promise in Smart City applications, its usage as a service is still in the early stages. In this paper, we propose to investigate the utilization of Quantum as a Service (QaaS) to develop an architecture for securing a Smart City. Our approach employs Quantum Classifiers, QBoost from D-Wave Leap Quantum Cloud and Variational Quantum Classifier, and PegaSoS Quantum Support Vector Classifier from IBM Quantum Services. These provide real-time data classification and a user-friendly dashboard to display security incidents in the Smart City. Among the three quantum classifiers considered for the proposed architecture, QBoost performed the best both regarding quality and processing time.  © 2023 ACM.",Quantum as a service; Quantum Machine Learning; Security; Smart City,Cybersecurity; Internet of things; Machine learning; Quantum computers; Cyber threats; Data volume; Intelligent operations; Machine-learning; Quantum as a service; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Security; Security incident; Sensitive informations; Smart city,,"KEIRETSU, (06/10/2014); SERICS, (PE00000014); Secure Safe Apulia - Regional Security Center; European Commission, EC, (H99J21010060001)","This study has been partially supported by the following projects: SSA (Secure Safe Apulia - Regional Security Center, Codice Progetto 6ESURE5) and KEIRETSU (Codice Progetto V9UFIL5) funded by ""Re-golamento regionale della Puglia per gli aiuti in esenzione n. 17 del 30/09/2014 (BURP n. 139 suppl. del 06/10/2014) TITOLO II CAPO 1 DEL REGOLAMENTO GENERALE ""Avviso per la presentazione dei progetti promossi da Grandi Imprese ai sensi dell’articolo 17 del Re-golamento""; SERICS (PE00000014) under the MUR National Recovery and Resilience Plan funded by the European Union - NextGen-erationEU; PON Ricerca e Innovazione 2014-202 FSE REACT-EU, Azione IV.4 “Dottorati e contratti di ricerca su tematiche dell’inno-vazione” CUP:H99J21010060001.","Angelelli M., Catalano C., Hill D., Koshutanski H., Pascarelli C., Rafferty J., A reference architecture proposal for secure data management in mobile health, 2022 7th International Conference on Smart and Sustainable Technologies (SpliTech).

Nevertheless, researchers and security professionals consider data collected from the dark web as one of the measures for proactive cybersecurity to combat cyber threats and cyber terrorism. Therefore, classifying dark web content with approaches ranging from machine learning to deep learning is researched extensively in the literature. Still, particular challenges remain with classifying dark web hidden services, for example, the limitation of the dataset to label hidden services and the requirement of substantial computing and storage resources to manage raw and unlabelled dark web data. The proposed work presented a quantum encoding-based approach to categorizing Tor hidden services. First, the dark web crawler crawled the Tor dark web to fetch hidden services. The classical model classifies hidden services into 12 categories. The 12 categories include law and government, forum, streaming services, social networking sites, food, travel, games, health and fitness, education, computer and technology, e-commerce, and business/corporate. The keyword dataset to label hidden services is created using scraping and cleaning surface web pages of each of the 12 categories. Thus authors address the first challenges of labelling hidden service data. The dark web crawler can crawl hundreds of hidden services in a stipulated time. The crawled data comprised HTML pages and associated files. Analysis of such vast data is demanding on computational resources. Recently, quantum computing is coming up as an alternative to classical models. Therefore, the authors proposed a quantum model to categorize crawled Tor hidden services with lesser time and minimize memory consumption. The proposed quantum model used Universal Sentence Encoder to encode classical data into quantum data as probabilities in the proposed work. The quantum circuit receives these probability values. Further, the quantum model applies the SoftMax function before comparing the output to actual category labels. The result shows the output of categorizing hidden services using a customized category-defining dataset with quantum encoding. Finally, the chapter compares the time and memory consumption between the classical and quantum model. © 2023 Scrivener Publishing LLC.",Cyber terrorism; Dark web; Hidden service; Onion services; Quantum circuit;

As a consequence of the proliferation of quantum applications, conventional commercial information systems and services are rapidly approaching the point at which they will be required to protect their networks, software, hardware, and data from being subjected to digital assaults. This is the case as a result of the fact that quantum applications have been expanding. In this paper, we take a look at the present level of quantum computing as well as the risks that are associated with the emergence of this new area. We next proceed to describe potential attack vectors against quantum computing systems and the countermeasures, precautions, and best practises that can be taken to protect against them. After that, we propose suggestions for proactively reducing the cyberattack surface through threat intelligence and by ensuring the security by design of quantum software and hardware components. © 2023 Scrivener Publishing LLC.",Cybersecurity; Quantum computing; Quantum education and training; Quantum software engineering,,,,,"2021 global threat report: Adversary trends analysis, (2021); Bitdefender, Cyberattack against UK supercomputer archer forces operators to disable access for scientists, (2021); News J., Forschungszentrum jülich-jsc-archiv newsletter ""jsc news""-cyberattack against supercomputers, (2021); More ransomware attacks on UK education-ncsc. gov. uk, (2021); Dunn N., An introduction to quantum computing for security professionals, (2021); Chen L., Jordan S., Liu Y.-K., Moody D., Peralta R., Perlner R., SmithTone D., Report on post-quantum cryptography, (2016); Moody D., Alagic G., Apon D.C., Cooper D.A., Dang Q.H., Kelsey J.M., Liu Y.-K., Miller C.A., Peralta R.C., Perlner R.A., Robinson A.Y., Smith-Tone D.C., Alperin-Sheriff J., Status report on the second round of the NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization process, (2020); Majot A., Yampolskiy R., Global catastrophic risk and security implications of quantum computers, Futures, 72, pp. 17-26, (2015); Flagship Q., Competence framework for quantum technologies compiled by Franziska Greinert and Rainer Müller version 1.0, (2021); Reuther A., Michaleas P., Jones M., Gadepally V., Samsi S., Kepner J., Survey of machine learning accelerators, (2020); Bertels K., Sarkar A., Krol A., Budhrani R., Samadi J., Geoffroy E., Matos J., Abreu R., Gielen G., Ashraf I., Quantum accelerator stack: A research roadmap, (2021); Theis T.N., Wong H.S.P., The end of Moore's law: A new beginning for information technology, Computing in Science and Engineering, 19, pp. 41-50, (2017); Horowitz M., 1.1 computing's energy problem (and what we can do about it), Digest of Technical Papers-IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference, 57, pp. 10-14, (2014); Landauer R., Irreversibility and heat generation in the computing process, IBM Journal of Research and Development, 5, pp. 183-191, (2010); Matteo O.D., Gheorghiu V., Mosca M., Fault tolerant resource estimation of quantum random-access memories, (2020); Preskill J., Quantum computing in the NISQ era and beyond, Quantum, 2, (2018); Sarovar M., Proctor T., Rudinger K., Young K., Nielsen E., Blume-Kohout R., Detecting crosstalk errors in quantum information processors, Quantum, 4, (2020); Pauka S.J., Das K., Kalra R., Moini A., Yang Y., Trainer M., Bousquet A., Cantaloube C., Dick N., Gardner G.C., Manfra M.J., Reilly D.J., A cryogenic CMOS chip for generating control signals for multiple qubits, Nature Electronics, 4, pp. 64-70, (2021); Gidney C., Ekera M., How to factor 2048 bit RSA integers in 8 hours using 20 million noisy qubits, (2019); IBM's roadmap for scaling quantum technology, (2021); Grover L.K., A fast quantum mechanical algorithm for database search, Proceedings of the Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, pp. 212-219, (1996); Tibbetts J., Quantum computing and cryptography: Analysis, risks, and recom-mendationsfor decisionmakers, (2019); SANS ICS control systems are a target, (2021); Pratte S., Fortozo S., Kispal G., Banvait A., Azazi A., Hiebert N., Strategies for secure software development, (2013); (2021); OAWSP top ten web application security risks, (2021); Threat landscape for industrial automation systems.

With the rapid development of quantum computers, some secure communication protocols based on certain mathematical problems will face a significant danger, and quantum properties can be used to construct quantum secure communication and quantum cryptography that can achieve unconditional security. Among many topics of quantum cryptography, quantum secret sharing (QSS) is an important and challenging issue that provides scenarios to store highly sensitive, important, and confidential information.

However, conventional communications in SAGIN still face data confidentiality issues. Fortunately, the concept of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) over SAGIN is able to provide information-theoretic security for secure communications in SAGIN with quantum cryptography. Therefore, in this article, we propose quantum-secured SAGIN (Q-SAGIN) which are feasible to achieve proven secure communications using quantum mechanics to protect data channels between space, aerial, and ground nodes. Moreover, we propose a universal QKD service provisioning framework to minimize the cost of QKD services under the uncertainty and dynamics of communications in Q-SAGIN. In this framework, fiber-based QKD services are deployed in passive optical networks with the advantages of low loss and high stability. Moreover, the widely covered and flexible satellite-and UAV-based QKD services are provisioned as a supplement during the real-time data transmission phase.

However, searching for target data in ciphertext takes effort. Therefore, searchable encryption has become an important research topic. On the other hand, since the advancement of quantum computers will lead to the crisis of cracking traditional encryption algorithms, it is necessary to design encryption schemes that can resist quantum attacks. Therefore, we propose a multi-keyword searchable identity-based proxy re-encryption scheme from lattices. In addition to resisting quantum attacks, the proposed scheme uses several cryptographic techniques to improve encryption efficiency. First, identity-based encryption is used to reduce the computation and transmission costs caused by certificates. Second, the proposed scheme uses proxy re-encryption to achieve the purpose of outsourced computing, allowing the proxy server to reduce the computation and transmission costs of the users. Third, the proposed multi-keyword searchable encryption can provide AND and OR operators to increase the flexibility of searchability. Moreover, the access structure of the proposed scheme is not based on a linear secret sharing scheme (LSSS), avoiding the errors caused by an LSSS-based structure in decryption or search results. Finally, we also give formal security proof of the proposed scheme under the decisional learning with errors assumption. © 2023 by the authors.",identity-based encryption; lattice-based cryptography; multi-keyword search; post-quantum cryptography; proxy re-encryption,,,"Information Security Research Center at National Sun Yat-sen University in Taiwan; Intelligent Electronic Commerce Research Center; Ministry of Education, MOE; National Science and Technology Council, NSTC, (110-2923-E-110-001-MY3, 112-2634-F-110-001-MBK)",This work was partially supported by the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) of Taiwan under grants 112-2634-F-110-001-MBK and 110-2923-E-110-001-MY3.

The author first analyzed the security issues of quantum image encryption algorithms based on image scrambling methods, namely that image scrambling methods have periodicity, which can ensure that the image can be restored after scrambling. If an image cannot be guaranteed to return to its original state after performing scrambling operations, legitimate users cannot obtain the secret information in the original image, and image scrambling loses its original meaning; However, the periodicity of image scrambling methods not only ensures that legitimate users can decrypt images, but also provides convenience for attackers to steal original image information. Secondly, it is pointed out that when evaluating and analyzing quantum image encryption algorithms, the evaluation indicators should include two parts: One is performance analysis, which is the analysis of the network complexity of quantum circuits. In quantum computing, the network complexity of quantum circuits is usually represented by the number of quantum basic logic gates. The second is security analysis, which mainly includes key analysis (including key space size and key sensitivity analysis), statistical analysis (including pixel correlation, histogram analysis, information fusion, and scatter plot distribution density analysis). Finally, experimental simulations have shown that the NPCR values of the plaintext and ciphertext images of the three images tend to 100%. The encrypted image histogram is evenly distributed, with very weak pixel correlation and high pixel change rate and information entropy. © 2023 The Author",Encryption technology; Image encryption; Quantum,,,,,"Li X., Wang G., Pan W., Research on the application of data encryption technology in communication security, International Journal of Autonomous and Adaptive Communications Systems, 14, 1-2, (2021);

TLS is one of the widely used security protocols that needs to be made quantum safe. However, PQC algorithms integration into TLS introduce various implementation overheads compared to traditional TLS that in battery powered embedded devices with constrained resources, cannot be overlooked. While there exist several works, evaluating the PQ TLS execution time overhead in embedded systems there are only a few that explore the PQ TLS energy consumption cost. In this paper, a thorough power/energy consumption evaluation and analysis of PQ TLS 1.3 on embedded systems has been made. A WolfSSL PQ TLS 1.3 custom implementation is used that integrates all the NIST PQC algorithms selected for standardisation as well as 2 out of 3 of those evaluated in NIST Round 4. Also 1 out of 2 of the BSI recommendations have been included. The PQ TLS 1.3 with the various PQC algorithms is deployed in a STM Nucleo evaluation board under a mutual and a unilateral client-server authentication scenario. The power and energy consumption collected results are analyzed in detail. The performed comparisons and overall analysis provide very interesting results indicating that the choice of the PQC algorithms in TLS 1.3 to be deployed on an embedded system may be very different depending on the device use as an authenticated or not authenticated, client or server. Also, the results indicate that in some cases, PQ TLS 1.3 implementations can be equally or more energy consumption efficient compared to traditional TLS 1.3.  © 2023 ACM.",energy consumption; post-quantum cryptography; resource-constrained systems; secure communication protocol,Authentication; Embedded systems; Network security; Quantum cryptography; Seebeck effect; Constrained systems; Cryptography algorithms; Embedded device; Embedded-system; Energy-consumption; Post quantum; Post quantum cryptography; Resource-constrained system; Secure communication protocols; Security protocols; Energy utilization,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (958478)",The work in this paper has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 programme ENERMAN under grant agreement No 958478.,"Banerjee U., Das S., Chandrakasan A.P., Accelerating Post-Quantum Cryptography using an Energy-Efficient TLS Crypto-Processor, 2020 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS), pp. 1-5, (2020); Barton J., Buchanan W.J., Pitropakis N., Sayeed S., Abramson W., Post Quantum Cryptography Analysis of TLS Tunneling on a Constrained Device, ICISSP.

As the race for quantum computing (QC) progresses, QC businesses and research organisations may be targeted by nation states, cybercriminals, and hacktivists for financial gain and destruction. This essay examines the state of QC technology and how cybersecurity is connected to QC. We now go into the dangers and recommended practises for preventing the quickly developing cybercrimes. Following that, we put out suggestions on how to proactively lower the cyberattack surface using threat intelligence and by ensuring that quantum software and hardware components are secure by design. Once large-scale and fault-tolerant Qcomp(Qcomp) are built, it is projected that the security of widely used public-key science techniques (such as RSA and elliptic-curve cryptography) would worsen. Due to the fact that these algorithms are at the core of modern society's IT infrastructure, including the financial industry, the potential threat is serious. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been working on a technique of standardising post-quantum cryptography (PQC), which is designed to be safe against Qcomp, even if the danger is unlikely to materialise in the predictable future. NIST has been examining the performance and security of fifteen potential algorithms (seven finalists and eight alternate candidates). Standardization should hasten the transition to PQC globally, not only in the United States. In this chapter, we will discuss current developments in Qcomp analysis and development as well as the security problems associated with public-key scientific algorithms. Then we cover NIST's ongoing PQC standardisation efforts and, therefore, the responses of various organisations in favour of the migration. Finally, we discuss potential difficulties with applying PQC in the actual world. © 2023 Scrivener Publishing LLC.",Cyberattacks crime; Encryption; Hackivists; Quantum computing; Quantum simulation,,,,,"Kilber N., Kaestle D., Wagner S., Cybersecurity for Quantum Computing, (2021); Hayes J., Quantum on the MONEY [quantum computing in financial services sector], Engineering & Technology, 14, 4, pp. 34-37, (2019); Kaur J., Ramkumar K.R., The recent trends in cyber security: A review, Journal of King Saud University-Computer and Information Sciences, (2021); Beavers J., Pournouri S., Recent cyber attacks and vulnerabilities in medical devices and healthcare institutions, Blockchain and clinical trial, pp. 249-267, (2019); Ahn J., Chung J., Kim T., Ahn B., Choi J., An overview of quantum security for distributed energy resources, 2021 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Power Electronics for Distributed Generation Systems (PEDG), pp. 1-7, (2021); Gompert D.C., Libicki M., Towards a Quantum Internet: Postpandemic Cyber Security in a Post-digital World, Survival, 63, 1, pp. 113-124, (2021); Wallden P., Kashefi E., Cyber security in the quantum era, Communications of the ACM, 62, 4, pp. 120-120, (2019); Moizuddin M., Winston J., Qayyum M., A comprehensive survey: Quantum cryptography, 2017 2nd International Conference on Anti-Cyber Crimes (ICACC), pp. 98-102, (2017); Rasool R.U., Ahmad H.F., Rafique W., Qayyum A., Qadir J., Quantum computing for healthcare: A review, (2022); Cheung K.F., Bell M.G., Bhattacharjya J., Cybersecurity in logistics and supply chain management: An overview and future research directions, Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 146, (2021); Rojasree V., Jayanthi J.G., A Competent Intelligent Key Cryptography (IKC) Architecture, 2021 5th International Conference on Computing Methodologies and Communication (ICCMC), pp. 166-173, (2021); Buchanan W., Woodward A., Will quantum computers be the end of public key encryption?, Journal of Cyber Security Technology, 1, 1, pp. 1-22, (2017); Chaubey N.K., Prajapati B.B., Quantum Cryptography and the Future of Cyber Security, (2020); Njorbuenwu M., Swar B., Zavarsky P., A survey on the impacts of quantum computers on information security, 2019 2nd International conference on data intelligence and security (ICDIS), (2019); Rohith C., Batth R.S., Cyber warfare: Nations cyber conflicts, cyber cold war between nations and its repercussion, 2019 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Knowledge Economy (ICCIKE), pp. 640-645, (2019); Lee C.C., Tan T.G., Sharma V., Zhou J., Quantum computing threat modelling on a generic cps setup, International Conference on Applied Cryptography and Network Security, pp. 171-190, (2021); Almansoori A., Ncube C., Salloum S.A., Internet of Things Impact on the Future of Cyber Crime, The International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision, pp. 643-655, (2021); Chamola V., Jolfaei A., Chanana V., Parashari P., Hassija V., Information security in the post quantum era for 5G and beyond networks: Threats to existing cryptography, and post-quantum cryptography, Computer Communications, 176, pp. 99-118, (2021)","V.

A quantum computer is an example of such a system. Quantum computers may be accessed over the internet. This technology poses a significant risk, since quantum terrorists, or cyber criminals, coul be able to cause many problems, including bringing down the internet. The principles of quantum mechanics might be used by evil doers to destroy quantum information on a global scale, and an entire class of suspicious codes could destroy data or eavesdrop on communication. Quantum physics, however, safeguards against data eavesdropping. A significant amount of money is being invested in developing and testing a quantum version of the internet that will eliminate eavesdropping and make communication nearly impenetrable to cyber-attacks. The simultaneous activation of quantum terrorists (organized crime) can lead to significant danger by attackers introducing quantum information into the network, breaking the global quantum state, and preventing the system from returning to its starting state. Without signs of identifying information and real-time communication data, such vulnerabilities are very hard to discover. Terrorists' synchronized and coordinated acts have an impact on security by sparking a cyber assault in a fraction of a second. The encryption is used by cyber-criminal groups with the genuine, nefarious, and terrible motives of killing innocent people or stealing money. In the hands of criminals and codes, cryptography is a dangerous and formidable weapon. Small amounts of digital information are hidden in a code string that translates into an image on the screen, making it impossible for the human eye to identify a coded picture from its uncoded equivalents. To steal the cryptographic key necessary to read people's credit card data or banking information, cyber thieves employ installed encryption techniques, human mistakes, keyboard loggers, and computer malware. This new volume delves into the latest cutting-edge trends and the most up-to-date processes and applications for quantum computing to bolster cybersecurity.

WBAN is a special category of wireless networks. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic creates the situation to monitor the patient remotely following the social distance. WBSN provides the way to effectively monitor the patient remotely with social distance. The data transmitted in WBSN are vulnerable to attacks and this is necessary to take security procedure like cryptographic protocol to protect the user data from attackers. Several physiological sensors are implanted in the human body that will collect various physiological updates to monitor the patient’s healthcare data remotely. The sensed information will be transmitted wirelessly to doctors all over the world. But it has too many security threats like data loss, masquerade attacks, secret key distribution problems, unauthorized access, and data confidentiality loss. When any attackers are attacking the physiological sensor data, there is a possibility of losing the patient’s information. The creation, cancellation, and clinical data adjustment will produce a mass effect on the healthcare monitoring system. Present-day cryptographic calculations are highly resistant to attacks, but the only weak point is the insecure movement of keys. In this paper, we look into critical security threats: secure key distribution. While sharing the secret key between communicating parties in the wireless body sensor networks in the conventional method like via phone or email, the attackers will catch the private key. They can decrypt and modify more sensitive medical data. It can cause a significant effect like death also. So need an effective, secure key distribution scheme for transmission of human body health related data to medical professional through wireless links. Moreover, a new enhanced BB84 Quantum cryptography protocol is proposed in this paper for sharing the secret key among communicating parties in a secure manner using quantum theory. Besides, a bitwise operator is combined with quantum concepts to secure the patient’s sensed information in the wireless environment. Instead of mail and phone via sharing secret key, quantum theory with the bitwise operator is used here. Therefore, it is not possible to hack the secret key of communication. The body sensor’s constrained assets as far as battery life, memory, and computational limit are considered for showing the efficiency of the proposed security framework. Based on experimental results, it is proven that the proposed algorithm EBB84QCP provides high secure key distribution method without direct sharing the secret key and it used the quantum mechanism and bitwise operator for generating and distributing secret key value to communicating parties for sensitive information sharing in the wireless body sensor networks. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Bennet and Brassard 84 protocol (BB84 protocol); Bitwise operator; Quantum cryptography (QC); Quantum key distribution (QKD); Wireless body sensor network (WBSN),Body sensor networks; COVID-19; Internet protocols; Monitoring; Network security; Physiology; Quantum cryptography; Quantum theory; Security systems; Sensitive data; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Bennet and brassard 84 protocol; Bitwise operators; Quantum cryptography; Quantum key distribution; Quantum-cryptography protocols; Secret key; Secure key distribution; Social distance; Wireless body sensor network; Wireless body sensor networks; Medical applications,,,,"A Fuzzy based data perturbation technique for privacy preserved data mining, International Conference on Emerging Trends in Information Technology and Engineering (Ic-Etite), (2020); Swarna Priya R.M., Maddikunta P.K.R., Parimala M., Koppua S., Gadekallua T.R., Chowdharya C.L., Alazab M., An effective feature engineering for DNN using hybrid PCA-GWO for intrusion detection in IoMT Architecture, Comput Commun, 160, pp. 139-149, (2020); Reddy G.T., Bhattacharya S., Siva Ramakrishna S., Chowdhary C.L., Hakak S., Kaluri A., Praveen Kumar Reddy M., An ensemble based machine learning model for diabetic retinopathy classification, International Conference on Emerging Trends in Information Technology and Engineering, (2020); Chowdhary C.L., Patel P.V., Kathrotia K.J., Attique M., Perumal K., Ijaz M.F., Analytical study of hybrid techniques for image encryption and decryption, Sensors, 20, (2020); Thippa Reddy G., Swarna Priya R.M., Parimala M., Chowdhary C.L., Praveen Kumar Reddy M., Hakak S., Khan W.Z., A deep neural networks based model for uninterrupted marine environment monitoring, Comput Commun, 157, pp. 64-75, (2020); Usman M., Asghar M.R., Ansar I.S., Qaraqe M., Security in wireless body area netwoks: From in-body to off body communications, IEEE Access, pp. 58064-58074, (2018); Sai Suguna Y., Kavya Reddy B., Keerthi Durga V., Roshini A., Secure quantum key distribution encryption method for efficient data communication in wireless body area sensor net-works, Int J Eng Technol, pp. 331-335, (2018); Zhang G.H., Poon C.C.Y., Zhang Y.T., A Review on Body Area Networks Security for Healthcare, (2018); AL-Mubayedh D., AL-Khalis M., AL-Azman G., AL-Abdali M., Al Fosail M., Nagy N., Quantum cryptography on IBM QX, International Conference on Computer Applications & Information Security, (2020); Ai-Janabi S., Al-Janabi S.H.A., Al-Shourbaji I., Shamshirband S., Survey of Main Challenges (Security and Privacy) in Wireless Body Area Networks for Healthcare Applications, (2017); Mehic M., Fazio P., Voznak M., Chromy E., Toward designing a quantum key distribution network simulation model, Inf Commun Technol Serv, 14, (2016); Zhao B., Zha X., Chen Z., Shi R., Wang D., Peng T., Longchuan Yan, Performance analysis of quantum key distribution technology for power business, Appl Sci, 20, (2020); Bennett C.H., Brassard G., Quantum cryptography: public key distribution and coin tossing, IEEE Conference on Computer, Systems and signal Processing, pp. 175-190, (1984); Kalra M., Poonia R.C., Design a new protocol and compare with BB84 protocol for quantum key distribution, Adv Intell Syst Comput, (2019); Rodimin V.E., Kiktenko E.O., Usova V.V., Ponomarev M.Y., Kazieva T.V., Miller A.V., Sokolov A.S., Kanapin A.A., Losev A.V., Trushechkin A.S., Anufriev M.N., Pozhar N.O., Kurochkin V.L., Kurochkin Y.V., Fedorov A.K., Modular quantum key distribution setup for research and development applications, J Russian Laser Res, 40, pp. 221-229, (2019); Abidi B., Jilbab A., Mohamed E.H., Wireless body area network for health monitoring, J Med Eng Technol, 43, (2019); Li M., Lou W., Worcester R.K., Data security and privacy in wireless body area networks, IEEE Wirel Commun, (2010); Khan H., Dowling B., Martin K.M., Highly efficient privacy-preserving key agreement for wireless body area networks, IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications (TrustCom), (2018); Wu L., Zhang Y., Li L., Shen J., Efficient and anonymous authentication scheme for wireless body area networks, J Med Syst, (2016); Archana B., Krithika S., Implementation of BB84 quantum key distribution using OptSim, IEEE International Conference on Electronics and Communication Systems (ICECS), (2015)","A.D.

It leverages benefits from physics, mathematics, and quantum principles in order to develop a computer with capabilities not ever witnessed before. Such a computer is based on complex physics and is able to store and process data in units of ""qubits""that enable electronics or photons to be available in more than one state simultaneously. A distinguishing characteristic of a quantum computer is its ability to perform certain calculations and solve or simulate complex problems exponentially faster than classical computers. From a governmental perspective, such a technology is a double-edged sword. A quantum computer that is able to break public-key cryptography may pose threats due to its potential to leak confidential and sensitive government information. On the other hand, quantum cryptography and quantum key distribution can lead to a secured communication where exchanged data are secured against cyber-attacks. Despite the absence of a fully realized quantum computer model, governments worldwide recognize the substantial potential of quantum technology to drive economic development and safeguard critical national security data, they have actively positioned themselves in the race to advance quantum technology. This survey reviews the research and development of several branches of quantum computing used for critical national infrastructures. It aims to map potential use cases of quantum computing with critical national infrastructure applications. The survey is divided into two main sections, namely, quantum communication and cryptography, and quantum networks, where each of these is further reviewed from different angles. This includes opportunities and challenges quantum computing can pose for governmental communications. Also, it reviews the advancement of quantum satellites and quantum drones for establishing a reliable quantum network. In addition, it touches on the use of quantum technologies within the realm of space. From the reviewed studies in this survey, it is concluded that despite the substantial effort and research in the quantum computing field, the practical integration of quantum computing into national infrastructure needs to be further studied to assess its implementation feasibility.  © 2023 ACM.",National infrastructure; Quantum communication; Quantum computing; Quantum cryptography; Quantum cybersecurity; Quantum drone; Quantum Internet; Quantum key distribution; Quantum navigation; Quantum satellite; Space,Complex networks; Cybersecurity; Digital storage; Drones; Economic and social effects; National security; Network security; Public key cryptography; Quantum communication; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Sensitive data; Cyber security; National infrastructure; Quanta computers; Quantum Computing; Quantum cybersecurity; Quantum drone; Quantum internet; Quantum navigation; Quantum satellite; Space; Quantum cryptography,,,,"What is quantum computing, (2023); Kitchen K., Quantum Computing: A National Security Primer, (2021); What is Quantum Computing?

Common quantum gates found in these systems are: phase shift, displacement, and squeezing gates. These gates are all unitary and reversible. Outside of quantum systems, coherent states also plays a significant role in coherent optical communications with speeds of hundreds of gigabits per second. Secure optical communications is generally implemented at the data layer with classical symmetric encryption such as Advanced Standard Encryption or AES. This inevitably allows any wiretapping to capture the transmitted data either in the plaintext mode or in the encrypted ciphertext mode in the optical infrastructure. The recent and rapid developments in Quantum computing further lift up the need for quantum secure communications in the optical infrastructure. This paper proposes a novel quantum encryption in the coherent optical domain utilizing a displacement operator and implementing with IQ-MZM optical modules, called Quantum Encryption in Phase Space or QEPS. The communication peers share a secret used to seed cryptographic pseudo random number generators to produce a synchronized random number at both the transmitter and receiver. The synchronized random numbers are used to establish displacement operators to encrypt the coherent states at the transmission and decrypt the cipher coherent states at the receiver. Therefore, malicious parties tapping along the fibre line would not extract the message in transit from optical domain due to a high Bit Error Rate or BER. The optimal displacement operator is split into a standard 16-QAM and a random phase shift operator to enhance the transmission security. We analysis the transmission security with the wiretap channel model for semantic security. We have simulated the QEPS encryption and decryption for two data modulation schemes: QPSK and 16-QAM over 80 km for transmission speeds of 56 Gbps for QPSK and 112 Gbps for 16-QAM. © 2023, The Author(s).",Coherent Detection; Coherent State; Digital Signal Processing or DSP; Displacement Operator; IQ-MZM; Phase Shift Operator; QKD; QPP; QPSK; Quadrature Amplitude Modulation or QAM; Quantum Communication; Quantum Decryption; Quantum Encryption; Symmetric cryptography; Symmetric encryption,Bit error rate; Number theory; Optical communication; Quadrature amplitude modulation; Quadrature phase shift keying; Quantum communication; Quantum cryptography; Quantum optics; Random number generation; Semantics; Coherent detection; Coherent state; Digital signal processing or DSP; Displacement operators; IQ-MZM; Phase shift operator; QKD; QPP; Quadrature amplitude modulation or QAM; Quantum decryption; Quantum encryption; Shift operators; Symmetric cryptography; Symmetric encryption; Digital signal processing,,,,"pp. 2022-2106; Grover L.K., A fast quantum mechanical algorithm for database search, Proceedings of the twenty-eighth annual ACM symposium on theory of computing, pp. 212-219, (1996); Shannon C.E., Communication theory of secrecy systems, Bell Syst Tech J, 28, 4, pp. 656-715, (1949); Kuang R., Bettenburg N., Shannon perfect secrecy in a discrete Hilbert space, 2020 IEEE international conference on quantum computing and engineering (QCE), pp. 249-255, (2020); Kuang R., Barbeau M., Quantum permutation pad for universal quantum-safe cryptography, Quantum Inf Process, 21, (2022); Kuang R., Perepechaenko M., Quantum encryption with quantum permutation pad in IBMQ systems, EPJ Quantum Technol, 9, (2022); Perepechaenko M., Kuang R., Quantum encrypted communication between two IBMQ systems using quantum permutation pad, 2022 11th international conference on communications, circuits and systems (ICCCAS), pp. 146-152, (2022); Perepechaenko M., Kuang R., Quantum encryption and decryption in IBMQ systems using quantum permutation pad, J Commun, 17, 12, pp. 972-978, (2022); Rivest R.L., Shamir A., Adleman L., A method for obtaining digital signatures and public-key cryptosystems, Commun ACM, 21, 2, pp. 120-126, (1978); Furht B., The RSA public-key encryption algorithm, (2006); Just M., Diffie–Hellman key agreement, pp. 341-342, (2011); Hankerson D., Menezes A.J., Vanstone S., Guide to elliptic curve cryptography, (2010); Johnson D., Menezes A., Vanstone S.A., The elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA), Int J Inf Secur, 1, 1, pp. 36-63, (2001); Shor P.W., Algorithms for quantum computation: discrete logarithms and factoring, Proceedings 35th annual symposium on foundations of computer science, pp. 124-134, (1994); Bos J., Ducas L., Kiltz E., Lepoint T., Lyubashevsky V., Schanck J.M., Schwabe P., Seiler G., Stehle D., Crystals – kyber: a CCA-secure module-lattice-based KEM, 2018 IEEE European symposium on security and privacy, pp. 353-367, (2018); D'Anvers J.-P., Karmakar A., Sinha Roy S., Vercauteren F., Saber: module-LWR based key exchange, CPA-secure encryption and CCA-secure KEM, Progress in cryptology – AFRICACRYPT 2018, pp. 282-305, (2018); Schanck J.M., A Comparison of NTRU Variants, (2018); Singh H., Code Based Cryptography: Classic Mceliece, (2019); Jao D., De Feo L., Towards quantum-resistant cryptosystems from supersingular elliptic curve isogenies, Post-quantum cryptography, pp. 19-34, (2011); Jao D., Supersingular isogeny key encapsulation, (2020); Robert D., Breaking SIDH in Polynomial Time, (2022); Castryck W., Decru T., An Efficient Key Recovery Attack on SIDH (Preliminary Version). 2022.

However, high-speed optical communication systems have a huge demand for pre-shared keys. On the other hand, the separation of the secure communications sub-system from the secure key distribution (SKD) sub-system increases potential security risks and introduces additional resources overhead. In this letter, we propose an artificial amplitude noise-based SKD scheme (AAN-SKD) in QAM/QNSC to generate secret key for legal parties accordingly. The two orthogonal PAM symbols are superimposed to generate QAM symbols. Thus, the AAN-SKD can also be implemented in PAM modulation. In addition, the data transmission and AAN-SKD are completed in the same channel. Experimental results indicate that the key generation rate and key consistency ratio of the proposed scheme can reach 188.22Mbit/s and 91%, respectively. Compared with quantum key distribution, the AAN-SKD has the advantage of lower cost, better compatibility, and a higher key rate. © 1997-2012 IEEE.",artificial amplitude noise; Quantum noise stream cipher; secure key distribution,Network layers; Network security; Optical fiber communication; Optical fibers; Pulse amplitude modulation; Quadrature amplitude modulation; Quantum cryptography; Quantum noise; Amplitude noise; Artificial amplitude noise; Cipher; Law; Optical-fiber communication; Probability: distributions; Quantum noise stream cipher; Secure key distribution; Stream Ciphers; Symbol; Probability distributions,,,,"Nakazawa M., Et al., QAM quantum stream cipher using digital coherent optical transmission, Opt.

Efficient digital signatures, ensuring integrity, authenticity and non-repudiation of data with information-Theoretical security are highly urgent and intractable open problems in cryptography. Here, we propose a high-efficiency quantum digital signature (QDS) protocol using asymmetric quantum keys acquired via secret sharing, one-Time universal2 hashing and a one-Time pad.We just need to use a 384-bit key to sign documents of lengths up to 264 with a security bound of 10-19. If a one-megabit document is signed, the signature efficiency is improved by more than 108 times compared with previous QDS protocols. Furthermore, we build the first all-in-one quantum secure network integrating information-Theoretically secure communication, digital signatures, secret sharing and conference key agreement and experimentally demonstrate this signature efficiency advantage. Our work completes the cryptography toolbox of the four information security objectives.  © TheAuthor(s) 2022.",Cryptography toolbox; Information-Theoretical security; One-Time universal<sub>2</sub>hashing;

To mitigate this situation, post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms have emerged. Among the algorithms evaluated by NIST in the third round of its PQC contest was the NTRU cryptosystem. The main drawback of this algorithm is the enormous amount of time required for the multiplication of polynomials in both the encryption and decryption processes. Therefore, the strategy of speeding up this algorithm using hardware/software co-design techniques where this operation is executed on specific hardware arises. Using these techniques, this work focuses on the acceleration of polynomial multiplication in the encryption process for resource-constrained devices. For this purpose, several hardware multiplications are analyzed following different strategies, taking into account the fact that there are no possible timing information leaks and that the available resources are optimized as much as possible. The designed multiplier is encapsulated as a fully reusable and parametrizable IP module with standard AXI4-Stream interconnection buses, which makes it easy to integrate into embedded systems implemented on programmable devices from different manufacturers.

Quantum computers perform operations exponentially faster by taking advantage of reversible operations. Reversible operations play an essential role in developing energy and cost-efficient circuits. The efficiency of a quantum circuit is measured in terms of Quantum cost and Quantum depth. In this paper, we propose an optimization algorithm for Entanglement-based Quantum error correction, which plays a crucial role in various applications like quantum teleportation, secure communications, quantum key distribution, etc. We performed the experiments using Qiskit and RCViewer+ tools. Qiskit tool is used to run the quantum algorithms and measure the quantum depth; the RCViewer+ tool is used to measure the quantum cost. The proposed algorithm optimizes the quantum cost and depth compared to the existing approaches. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Entanglement purification; Quantum cost; Quantum error correction; Quantum information; Reversible computation; Reversible logic gates,,,"International Business Machines Corporation, IBM",We are extremely grateful to the IBM team for providing access to IBM Quantum Experience (QE).

We find that a single coin can generate MESPS at recurrent time steps (periodically) via discrete-time quantum walks on both 4- and 8-site cyclic graphs. This scheme is resource saving, with possibly the most straightforward experimental realization since the same coin is applied at each time step. We also show that recurrent MESPS can be generated on any arbitrary k-site cyclic graph, k≈{3,4,5,8} via effective-single (identity and arbitrary coin) or two-coin evolution sequences. Beyond their use in fundamental research, we propose an application of the generated MESPS in quantum cryptography protocols. MESPS as cryptographic keys can strengthen quantum-secure communication.  © 2023 American Physical Society.

In this article, we present two novel techniques for accelerating the implementation of polynomial convolution on a graphics processing unit (GPU), utilizing advanced Tensor cores, which benefit the performance of key encapsulations. First, a polynomial restructuring technique is proposed to allow several polynomials with distinct public keys to be processed in a single communication cycle. This is an improvement compared to the previous work by Lee et al. Next, we observe that polynomial convolution in some key encapsulation mechanisms contains reduction patterns that are not friendly to parallel implementation. We propose separating the multiplication and reduction processes so they can be parallelized independently. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed techniques, we applied it to two key-encapsulation mechanisms from the Scabbard post-quantum key-encapsulation mechanism suite and evaluate their performance. Experimental results show that polynomial convolution using Tensor cores is 1.05× faster (for the Florete scheme) and 3.6× faster (for the Sable scheme) than using compute unified device architecture core-based multiplication with conventional cores on a GPU. The Tensor cores-based encapsulations and decapsulations are faster than a reference implementation on a CPU supporting AVX2 by more than 5.6× and 6.4× , respectively, for the Florete scheme and 8.3× and 13.3× faster, respectively, for the Sable scheme. This shows that the proposed techniques can achieve significantly higher throughput for key exchange and encapsulation mechanisms, which are important for securing IoT applications.  © 2023 IEEE.",Cryptography; general matrix multiplication (GEMM); lattice-based cryptography; polynomial convolution; post-quantum cryptography (PQC); tensor cores,Computer graphics; Convolution; Graphics processing unit; Internet of things; Program processors; Public key cryptography; Quantum cryptography; Tensors; De-capsulation; General matrix multiplication; High-throughput; Key encapsulation mechanisms; Lattice-based cryptography; MAtrix multiplication; Performance; Polynomial convolution; Post quantum cryptography; Tensor core; Polynomials,,"C3I Center-Cyber Security Center; Gachon University Research fund, (GCU-202110270001); Ministry of Communication and Information Technology, MCIT; Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, IITK; Department of Information Technology, Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, DIT, (2019H1D3A1A01102607); Department of Information Technology, Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, DIT; Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, FWO; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","The work of Muhammad Asfand Hafeez and Seong Oun Hwang was supported by the Gachon University Research fund under Grant GCU-202110270001.

Here, we propose and demonstrate a self-chaotic microlaser with enhanced chaotic bandwidth for high-speed random bit generation. By designing tri-mode interaction in a deformed square microcavity laser, we realize a self-chaotic laser caused by two-mode internal interaction, and achieve an enhanced chaotic standard bandwidth due to the photon-photon resonance effect by introducing the third mode. Moreover, 500 Gb/s random bit generation is realized and the randomness is verified by the NIST SP 800-22 statistics test. Our demonstration promises the applications of microlasers in secure communication, chaos radar, and optical reservoir computing, and also provides a platform for the investigations of multimode nonlinear laser dynamics.  © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.",chaotic bandwidth enhancement; microcavity laser; random bit generation; self-chaos,Microcavities; Optical communication; Photons; Quantum cryptography; Semiconductor lasers; Bandwidth enhancement; Chaotic bandwidth enhancement; Chaotic semiconductor lasers; Chaotics; Cryptographic key; High Speed; Microcavity laser; Microlaser; Random bit generations; Self-chaos; Bandwidth,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12274407, 61874113, 61935018, 62122073); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (XDB43000000)","Research funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61935018, 12274407, 61874113, 62122073), and Strategic Priority Research Program, Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB43000000).

With the continuous advancement in the technical field, cloud computing has played a significant role in enabling the user to share, store and retrieve data from anywhere at any time. The involvement of many users in cloud computing, questions the security of the data present on the cloud. Existing features in cloud security are vulnerable to potential risks including lack of confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. In this paper, we propose a new data security mechanism using newly proposed hybrid encryption system (HES) and quantum key distribution (QKD) for secured data communication in cloud networks. The newly proposed HES uses the standard cryptographic algorithms namely AES and RSA for performing effective encryption and decryption processes. The newly proposed QKD is ensured the secured data communications by generating and distributing the reliable keys to the authorized users. Moreover, the novelty is introduced in the suggested model ensures reliable distribution of keys among the users and in turn preserves the data through secure hybrid encryption. At the end, the scrutiny of the proposed system proves that it is preferable that the existing models in terms of secure communication, reliability and performance. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",Advanced Encryption Standard;

Quantum identity authentication (QIA) can ensure the unconditional security of identity code. In this paper, we propose a multi-party simultaneous quantum identity authentication (MSQIA) protocol based on the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. In the protocol, N certified users can directly send their identity codes to the authenticator Alice simultaneously through quantum channels without classical communication, which enables Alice to authenticate their identity at the same time. Our protocol only requires Alice to perform the single-photon measurement. In theory, this protocol is unconditionally secure and one pair of (N + 1)-photon GHZ state can transmit N bits of identity codes. Our MSQIA protocol has application potential in the quantum communication field in the near future.

Towards application, the secret key rate (SKR) is a key figure of merit for any QKD system. The SKR has so far been limited to about a few megabits per second. Here we report a QKD system that is able to generate keys at a record high SKR of 115.8 Mb s–1 over a 10 km standard optical fibre, and distribute keys over up to 328 km of ultralow-loss fibre. Such abilities are attributed to a multipixel superconducting nanowire single-photon detector with an ultrahigh counting rate, an integrated transmitter that can stably encode polarization states with low error, a fast post-processing algorithm for generating keys in real time and the high system clock rate operation. The results demonstrate the feasibility of practical high-rate QKD with photonic techniques, thus opening its possibility for widespread applications. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,Optical fibers; Particle beams; Photons; Counting rates; High rate; Integrated transmitter; Key figures; Loss fibres; Multipixels; Polarization state; Quantum-key distribution system; Secret key; Superconducting nanowire single photon detectors; Quantum cryptography,,"Anhui Initiative in Quantum Information Technologies; Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology, (2021ZD0300300); Shanghai Academic/Technology Research Leader, (21XD1403800); Tencent Foundation; Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai, (22ZR1468100); Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai; Shanghai Science and Technology Development Foundation, (22JC1402900); Shanghai Science and Technology Development Foundation; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62031024, 62071151); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, STCSM, (2019SHZDZX01); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, STCSM; Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province, (2020B0303020001); Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province","We would like to thank B.

This paper proposes a scheme of controlled remote quantum state preparation and quantum teleportation based on multiple communication parties, and a nine-qubit entanglement channel is used to achieve secure communication of multiple devices in the IoT. The channel preparation, measurement operation, and unitary operation of the scheme were successfully simulated on the IBM Quantum platform, and the entanglement degree and reliability of the channel were verified through 8192 shots. The scheme's application in the IoT was analyzed, and the steps and examples of the scheme in the secure communication of multiple devices in the IoT are discussed. By simulating two different attack modes, the effect of the attack on the communication scheme in the IoT was deduced, and the scheme's high security and anti-interference ability was analyzed. Compared with other schemes from the two aspects of principle and transmission efficiency, it is highlighted that the advantages of the proposed scheme are that it overcomes the single fixed one-way or two-way transmission protocol form of quantum teleportation in the past and can realize quantum communication with multiple devices, ensuring both security and transmission efficiency.",controlled quantum teleportation; IoT security; multi-device communication; quantum communication; remote state preparation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14248220,,,37896568.0,English,Sensors (Basel),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85175277295,continuous development internet thing iot technology industry awareness security iot also increasing adoption quantum communication technology significantly improve communication security various device iot paper proposes scheme controlled remote quantum state preparation quantum teleportation based multiple communication party ninequbit entanglement channel used achieve secure communication multiple device iot channel preparation measurement operation unitary operation scheme successfully simulated ibm quantum platform entanglement degree reliability channel verified shot scheme application iot analyzed step example scheme secure communication multiple device iot discussed simulating two different attack mode effect attack communication scheme iot deduced scheme high security antiinterference ability analyzed compared scheme two aspect principle transmission efficiency highlighted advantage proposed scheme overcomes single fixed oneway twoway transmission protocol form quantum teleportation past realize quantum communication multiple device ensuring security transmission efficiency,6

The Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) entangled state is the basic resource for quantum cryptographic communication due to the existence of multipartite quantum correlations. An unconditional and efficient quantum network can be established with a continuous variable (CV) GHZ entangled state because of its deterministic entanglement. Here, we report an implementation of QC scheme using a CV multipartite GHZ entangled state. The submodes of a quadripartite GHZ entangled state are distributed to four spatially separated users. The proposed QC scheme is proved to be secure even when the entanglement is distributed through lossy quantum channels and the collective Gaussian attacks are in the all lossy channels. The presented QC scheme has the capability to be directly extended to a larger scale quantum network by using entangled states with more submodes.  © 2023 Chinese Laser Press.",,Communication channels (information theory); Electron energy analyzers; Quantum communication; Quantum cryptography; Secure communication; Conference network; Continuous variables; CryptoGraphics; Deterministics; Gaussians; Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger entangled state; Lossy quantum channel; Quantum correlations; Quantum network; Secret key; Quantum entanglement,,"Program for the Innovative Talents of Higher Education Institutions of Shanxi; Program for the Outstanding Innovative Teams of Higher Learning Institutions of Shanxi; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11834010, 12147215, 61925503, 62122044, 62135008); Fund for Shanxi Key Subjects Construction","Funding.

To establish a secure connection, a SatQKD session must be conducted to each user over a dynamically changing free-space link, all within just a few hundred seconds. Because of the short time and large losses under which the QKD protocol will be implemented, it has not yet been possible to form a complete key by transmitting all the relevant information required within a single overpass of the satellite. Here, we demonstrate a real-time QKD system that is capable of forming a 4.58-megabit secure key between two nodes within an emulated satellite overpass. We anticipate that our system will set the stage for practical implementations of intercontinental quantum secure communications that can operate over large networks of nodes and enable the secure transmission of data globally. © 2023 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

The data collected fuel many automation applications such as smart cities, industrial automation 5.0, autonomous vehicles and healthcare sectors. However, the critical challenges concerning such an environment are Open Web Security and Mutual Authentication. The recent security protocols of IoT are based on hard mathematical cryptographic structures. Nevertheless, dependency on the security of classical cryptographic primitives is at risk of being broken by Quantum Computing. Recent Quantum attacks on IoT security have motivated us to survey Quantum-resistant solutions comprehensively. Therefore in this paper, we analysed how the technology shifts from classical cryptographic techniques towards quantum-enabled solutions to achieve end-to-end security. The main objective of this survey is to provide a systematic roadmap in the area of Quantum secured 5G-enabled IoT communication by covering current research on 5G-enabled IoT with its key enabling technologies, threats imposed on 5G-enabled IoT applications, state-of-the-art quantum-based solutions and initiatives. A detailed overview of the quantum computing preliminaries, Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) schemes, Quantum Cryptography (QC), and Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) with their significant advantage in securing IoT-enabled communication over classical scenarios are also presented. Particularly, we emphasize Post-Quantum resistant techniques that must be used soon to secure 5G-enabled IoT communications. The comparative analysis of quantum-resistant schemes with classical cryptographic schemes in terms of key size, data size, time complexity and impact of quantum computers on these schemes are discussed. This paper identifies the technical challenges in Quantum-based schemes and provides future research directions to enable Post-Quantum resistant cryptography for secure communication in 5G-enabled IoT. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Internet of Things; Post quantum cryptography; Quantum cryptography; Review; Security; Wireless sensor networks,,,,,"Chettri L., Bera R., A comprehensive survey on Internet of Things (IoT) toward 5G wireless systems, IEEE Internet Things J., 7, 1, pp. 16-32, (2019); Li S., Da Xu L., Zhao S., 5G Internet of Things: A survey, J.

In this paper, we review current security recommendations, existing security libraries, and the support of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) in widely-used security protocols. We also present a practical assessment of recently selected PQC algorithms by the National Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST) PQC standardization on typical platforms that can be deployed in intelligent infrastructures (e.g., smartphones and single-boards), and recently recommended hash-based signatures for software/firmware signing. Finally, we discuss how incoming post-quantum migration affects selected areas in intelligent infrastructures. © 2023 Owner/Author.",Applied Cryptography; Assessment; Performance; Post-Quantum Cryptography; Security Protocols; Security Recommendations,Cybersecurity; Information services; Quantum cryptography; Quantum theory; 'current; Applied cryptography; Assessment; Cyber security; Intelligent infrastructures; Performance; Post quantum; Post quantum cryptography; Security protocols; Security recommendation; Network security,,"Ministerstvo Vnitra České Republiky, (VJ03030014)",This work is supported by Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic under Grant VJ03030014.,"Alagic G., Apon D., Cooper D., Dang Q., Dang T., Kelsey J., Lichtinger J., Miller C., Moody D., Peralta R., Et al., Status report on the third round of the NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization process, US Department of Commerce, NIST, (2022); Aragon N., Paulo S.L.M.B., Bettaieb S., Bidoux L., Blazy O., Deneuville J., Gaborit P., Gueron S., Guneysu T., Melchor C.A., Et al., BIKE: Bit flipping key encapsulation, (2017); Bae S., Chang Y., Park H., Kim M., Shin Y., A Performance Evaluation of IPsec with Post-Quantum Cryptography, Information Security and Cryptology-ICISC 2022: 25th International Conference, ICISC 2022, pp. 249-266, (2023); Barton J., Pitropakis N., Buchanan W., Sayeed S., Abramson W., Post quantum cryptography analysis of TLS tunneling on a constrained device, Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Information Systems Security and Privacy-ICISSP, pp. 551-561, (2022); Bernstein D.J., Hopwood D., Hulsing A., Lange T., Niederhagen R., Papachristodoulou L., Schneider M., Schwabe P., Wilcox-O'Hearn Z., SPHINCS: Practical stateless hash-based signatures, Advances in Cryptology-EUROCRYPT 2015: 34th Annual International Conference on the Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques, pp. 368-397, (2015); Bernstein D.J., Hulsing A.T., Lange T., Post-Quantum Cryptography-Integration study, (2022); Bindel N., Braun J., Gladiator L., Stockert T., Wirth J., X509-compliant hybrid certificates for the post-quantum transition, Journal of Open Source Software, 4, 40, (2019); Bos J., Ducas L., Kiltz E., Lepoint T., Lyubashevsky V., Schanck J.M., Schwabe P., Seiler G., Stehle D., CRYSTALS-Kyber: A CCA-Secure Module-Lattice-Based KEM, 2018 IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (EuroS&P), pp. 353-367, (2018); Bozhko J., Hanna Y., Harrilal-Parchment R., Tonyali S., Akkaya K., Performance Evaluation of Quantum-Resistant TLS for Consumer IoT Devices, 2023 IEEE 20th Consumer Communications&Networking Conference (CCNC).

Three-dimensional printing security focuses on protecting both the individual Industrial Internet of Things (I-IoT) AM devices and the networks that connect hundreds of these machines together. Additionally, rapid improvements in quantum computing demonstrate a vital need for robust security in a post-quantum future for critical AM manufacturing, especially for applications in, for example, the medical and defense industries. In this paper, we discuss the attack surface of adversarial data manipulation on the physical inter-device communication bus, Controller Area Network (CAN). We propose a novel, hierarchical tree solution for a secure, post-quantum-supported security framework for CAN-based AM devices. Through using subnet hopping between isolated CAN buses, our framework maintains the ability to use legacy or third-party devices in a plug-and-play fashion while securing and minimizing the attack surface of hardware Trojans or other adversaries. The results of the physical implementation of our framework demonstrate 25% and 90% improvement in message costs for authentication compared to existing lightweight and post-quantum CAN security solutions, respectively. Additionally, we performed timing benchmarks on the normal communication (hopping) and authentication schemes of our framework. © 2023 by the authors.",3D printing; additive manufacturing; Controller Area Network; cybersecurity; lightweight cryptography; post-quantum cryptography,Additives; Authentication; Control system synthesis; Controllers; Cybersecurity; Internet of things; Malware; Network security; Process control; Quantum cryptography; Supply chains; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Controller-area network; Cyber security; Light-weight cryptography; Manufacturing devices; Network-based; Post quantum; Post quantum cryptography; Security solutions; 3D printing,,"U.S. Department of Defense, DOD; Office of Local Defense Community Cooperation, OLDCC","This study was prepared under contract with Himanshu Thapliyal, with financial support from the Office of Local Defense Community Cooperation, Department of Defense.

Quantum communication is regarded as a promising new form of secure communication. However, the cross-media transmission of quantum pulses tends to suffer from severe attenuation, which inevitably degrades the security of the whole system. In this paper, we consider the configuration of the continuous-variable quantum key distribution through an air–water cross-media channel that involves the lower-atmospheric channel, the underwater channel, and the air–water interface. We consider the effect of air bubbles in seawater, and the effect of the dynamic air–water interface as well. In particular, dynamic characteristics of light extinction and fluctuations caused by seawater and bubbles have been demonstrated with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Based on this MC-based model, we demonstrate the communication viability, and simulation results show that in clear seawater conditions with a wind speed of 5 m/s and a zenith angle of 15◦, the receiver is able to achieve an effective secret key rate (10−4 bits/pulse) even at 9.71 m depth. Smaller zenith angles and lower wind speeds contribute to an increase in the interface secret key rate. © 2023 Optica Publishing Group.",,Light extinction; Monte Carlo methods; Optical communication; Phase interfaces; Quantum cryptography; Seawater; Air-water; Air/Water Interfaces; Continuous variables; Cross-media; Key feature; Media channel; Media transmission; New forms; Secret key; Zenith angle; Wind,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61871407); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (2021JJ30878); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province; Key Research and Development Program of Hunan Province of China, (2022GK20162020GK4063); Key Research and Development Program of Hunan Province of China",Funding.

Additionally, major component manufacturers monitor the performance of installed components, increasingly via public communication infrastructures. While these communications enable efficiencies and increased reliability, they also expand the cyber-attack surface. Communications may use the internet to remote control a facility’s control systems, or it may involve sending control commands over a network from a control room to a machine. The content could be encrypted and decrypted using a public key to protect the communicated information. These cryptographic encoding and decoding schemes become vulnerable as more advances are made in computer technologies, such as quantum computing. In contrast, quantum key distribution (QKD) and other quantum cryptographic protocols are not based upon a computational problem, and offer an alternative to symmetric cryptography in some scenarios. Although the underlying mechanism of quantum cryptogrpahic protocols such as QKD ensure that any attempt by an adversary to observe the quantum part of the protocol will result in a detectable signature as an increased error rate, potentially even preventing key generation, it serves as a warning for further investigation. In QKD, when the error rate is low enough and enough photons have been detected, a shared private key can be generated known only to the sender and receiver. We describe how this novel technology and its several modalities could benefit the critical infrastructures of dams or hydropower facilities. The presented discussions may be viewed as a precursor to a quantum cybersecurity roadmap for the identification of relevant threats and mitigation. © 2023 by the authors.",critical infrastructure; cyber-physical security; dams; hydropower; QKD; QKD post-processing; quantum key distribution; quantum security,Cybersecurity; Dams; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Public works; Quantum cryptography; Remote control; Centralised; Component manufacturers; Cyber-Physical securities; Error rate; Hydropower; Performance; Post-processing; Quantum key distribution post-processing; Quantum security; Remote Control Room; article; computer security; control system; controlled study; cyberattack; hydropower; Internet; mitigation; photon; reliability; remote control; security; Critical infrastructures,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (DGE-2152168); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-AC05-00OR22725, DE-FG2-13ER41967); Army Research Office, ARO, (W911NF-19-1-0397); Oak Ridge National Laboratory, ORNL; Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response, CESER","Funding text 1: Funding for this work was provided in part by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Cybersecurity Energy Security and Emergency Response (CESER) through the Risk Management Tools and Technologies (RMT) Program, and in part by the Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) under US DOE Grant No. DE-FG2-13ER41967.

So, the word Att. means that it only keeps Att. on those parts which are relevant to both object and keywords in the question. We are not considering the outlier to reduce the chances of mistakes. To combine the results from the image and given questions we are using multi-layer awareness. In this proposal of QC in field of VQA and LSTM, we tried to use this concept of MM Networks and presented our view on vulnerability of a primary/novel kind of attack that we call as DKMB. This hard kind of theft breaks the complex fusion (Combinations) mechanism take into consideration by a prime state-of-art networks to fuse BDs which are both effective, efficient, and stealthy.

The addition of many sensor devices in wireless connection forms a wireless sensor network (WSN). To achieve data security in WSN, an efficient, secure, and authorized communication mechanism is required among remote entities. Many computationally efficient authenticated key agreement (AKA) schemes have been proposed to ensure secure and authorized communication in the pre-quantum era for WSNs. The security of most of these schemes relies on the hardness of either factoring or discrete log problem. Due to Shor’s algorithm, these problems can be solved in polynomial time on any high-scale quantum computer. Hence, the AKA schemes proposed using classical cryptographic schemes will become insecure once the high-scale quantum computer becomes a reality. So, there is a requirement for the construction of new AKA designs which can resist quantum attacks. This article presents a lattice-based AKA for WSN to achieve the goal of post-quantum security and efficiency. The proposed solution is achieved using the computational problem of ring learning with errors (RLWE), where the user establishes authorized and secure communication with sensors. We have demonstrated a formal security analysis of our proposed scheme. The analysis of performance along with a comparative study are also included regarding performance comparison with existing schemes. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Authentication;

However, data security and authentication are still challenging as sensitive data is collected and shared in RCAV using an open channel, i.e., the Internet. The existing security of Internet-of-Drones (IoD) communication mainly depends on the hardness of discrete logarithms and factorization problems. However, due to Shor's algorithm, both authorized and secure transmissions are challenging in the presence of highly scalable quantum computers. To mitigate the aforementioned issues and challenges, in this article, we propose an authorized and secure communication scheme for IoD based on Ring Learning With Error (RLWE) problem on lattices, which have the potential to sustain low computation and quantum attacks. The proposed scheme supports mutual authentication and has an efficient session establishment. The evaluation results show that the proposed scheme has superior performance as compared to the existing state-of-the-art solutions on benchmark data sets using various evaluation metrics. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",Authentication; internet of drones; internet of things; lattice-based cryptography; quantum security,Antennas; Authentication; Benchmarking; Hexane; Internet of things; Internet protocols; Military applications; Network security; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Sensitive data; Aerial vehicle; Communications protocols; Internet of drone; Lattice; Lattice-based cryptography; Quantum Computing; Quantum security; Security; Sensor processors; Sensor/actuator; Drones,,,,"Sun J., Xiong H., Zhang S., Liu X., Yuan J., Deng R.H., A secure flexible and tampering-resistant data sharing system for vehicular social networks, IEEE Trans.

To achieve long-distance secure communication and scale expansion against inherent channel loss, trusted relays, which are assumed to be absolutely secure, are introduced into QKD networks. However, in practice, trusted relays may be compromised by attacks from ubiquitous eavesdroppers even protected by powerful hardware. Thus, how to ensure the security of end-to-end key distribution in partially-trusted relay QKD networks with the coexistence of trusted relays and untrusted relays becomes a challenging but urgent problem to be solved. To address this critical problem, in this article, we design a segment-based multipath key distribution method. The basic idea of the method is to maximize the security of the end-to-end key distribution through the segment-based multipath key distribution. Under the premise of security level requirements, we further propose a flexible key reconstruction scheme to improve the efficiency of key distribution and obtain available secret keys as many as possible. The extensive simulations are conducted and the results reveal that our method significantly outperforms the traditional multipath QKD method in terms of both security and efficiency. © 2023 IEEE.",,Efficiency; Information theory; Network security; Quantum communication; Quantum optics; Key distribution; Multipath; Of quantum-information; Quantum channel; Quantum information technologies; Quantum network; Relay; Secure key exchanges; Security; Segment-based; Quantum cryptography,,"Anhui Initiative in Quantum Information Technologies, (AHY150300); Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology, (2021ZD0301301); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, YIPA CAS, (Y202093)","This work is supported in part by Anhui Initiative in Quantum Information Technologies under grant No. AHY150300, Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology under grant No. 2021ZD0301301, and Youth Innovation Promotion Association of CAS under grant No. Y202093.","Arute F., Et al., Quantum Supremacy Using a Programmable Superconducting Processor, Nature, 574, 7779, pp. 505-510, (2019); Shor P.W., Polynomial-Time Algorithms for Prime Factorization and Discrete Logarithms on a Quantum Computer, Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Review, 41, 2, pp. 303-332, (1999); Wootters W.K., Zurek W.H., A Single Quantum Cannot Be Cloned, Nature, 299, 5886, pp. 802-803, (1982); Wang S., Et al., Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution Over 830-Km Fibre, Nature Photonics, 16, 2, pp. 154-161, (2022); Chen Y.-A., Et al., An Integrated Space-to-Ground Quantum Communication Network Over 4,600 Kilometres, Nature, 589, 7841, pp. 214-219, (2021); Sibson P., Et al., Chip-Based Quantum Key Distribution, Nature Commun, 8, 1, pp. 1-6, (2017); Ribezzo D., Et al., Deploying an Inter-European Quantum Network, Advanced Quantum Technologies, 2022; Mehic M., Et al., Quantum Key Distribution: A Networking Perspective, ACM Computing Surveys, 53, 5, (2020); Lo H.-K., Curty M., Qi B., Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution, Physical Review Letters, 108, 13, (2012); Zhou H., Et al., Quantum Network: Security Assessment and Key Management, IEEE/ACM Trans.

By integrating quantum secure communication with the IoT, we can provide a higher level of security and privacy protection to counteract security threats in the IoT. In this paper, a hybrid quantum communication scheme using six-qubit entangled states as a channel is proposed for specific IoT application scenarios. This scheme achieves hierarchical control of communication protocols on a single quantum channel. In the proposed scheme, device A transmits data to device B through quantum teleportation, while device B issues control commands to device A through remote quantum state preparation technology. These two tasks are controlled by control nodes C and D, respectively. The transmission of information from device A to device B is a relatively less important task, which can be solely controlled by control node C. On the other hand, issuing control commands from device B to device A is a more crucial task requiring joint control from control nodes C and D. This paper describes the proposed scheme and conducts simulation experiments using IBM’s Qiskit Aer quantum computing simulator. The results demonstrate that the fidelity of the quantum teleportation protocol (QTP) and the remote state preparation protocol (RSP) reach an impressive value of 0.999, fully validating the scheme’s feasibility. Furthermore, the factors affecting the fidelity of the hybrid communication protocol in an IoT environment with specific quantum noise are analyzed. By combining the security of quantum communication with the application scenarios of the IoT, this paper presents a new possibility for IoT communication. © 2023 by the authors.",hierarchical controlled hybrid quantum communication; IoT communication; quantum noise; quantum secure communication; six-qubit entangled state,Internet of things; Quantum cryptography; Quantum entanglement; Quantum noise; Qubits; quantum dot; Application scenario; Communications protocols; Control command; Control nodes; Hierarchical controled hybrid quantum communication; Internet of thing communication; Quantum secure communication; Security and privacy protection; Security threats; Six-qubit:entangled state; article; communication protocol; controlled study; hybrid; internet of things; noise; simulation; simulator; Quantum communication,,"National Key R&D Plan, (2022YFB3304303); Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program, (2022YFG0316, 2023ZHCG0004); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62172060)","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (62172060), the Sichuan Science and Technology Program (2022YFG0316, 2023ZHCG0004), and the National Key R&D Plan: 2022YFB3304303.","Xie Y.M., Lu Y.S., Weng C.X., Cao X.Y., Jia Z.Y., Bao Y., Wang Y., Fu Y., Yin H.L., Chen Z.B., Breaking the Rate-Loss Bound of Quantum Key Distribution with Asynchronous Two-Photon Interference, PRX Quantum, 3, (2022); Zhou L., Lin J., Xie Y.M., Lu Y.S., Jing Y., Yin H.L., Yuan Z., Experimental Quantum Communication Overcomes the Rate-Loss Limit without Global Phase Tracking, Phys.

This is essential to avoid any threat of the breaching of secret information on the part of hackers during the communication. In this regard, in contrast to routine classical methods, state-of-the-art robust quantum methods of secure communication such as quantum cryptography and Internet of Things (IoTs) information via quantum coherence medium and quantum networking of IoTs are gaining immense interest. In this context, chiral atomic medium and 2D materials such as graphene have attracted tremendous research interest. This owes to their remarkable linear and nonlinear ultrafast response and tunable structural and optoelectronic properties, which have potential applications in quantum computing, quantum information processing, information storage, and secure communication of IoTs information. In this paper, we explore the potential of Landau-quantized graphene (LQG) for secure communication of IoTs information by investigating quantum coherence-based propagation of light and optical properties of LQG. We report on the tunable optical response of a newly-proposed four-level ladder-type LQG subject to a weak probe field in conjunction with two strong control fields. In particular, employing the density-matrix approach, we report on theoretical analysis of superluminal/subluminal and absorption-free light propagation via quantum coherence in view of tunable electromagnetically induced transparency. Based on the tunable optical response of LQG, we propose a quantum networking model for the secure communication of quantum information via IoTs quantum networking. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Electromagnetically Induced Transparency; Internet Of Things; Landau-Quantized Graphene; Quantum Coherence; Quantum Information; Secure Communication,Digital storage; Information management; Internet of things; Optical communication; Personal computing; Quantum communication; Quantum cryptography; Quantum optics; Secure communication; Transparency; 'current; Data and information; Electromagnetically-induced transparency; Information explosion; Landau-quantized graphene; Optical response; Quantum coherence; Quantum Information; Quantum networking; Tunables; Graphene,,,,"Abergel D.S.L., Falko V.I., Optical and magneto-optical far-infrared properties of bilayer graphene, Phys.

In advancing these efforts, laws and policies govern these environments placing protections, standards, and developmental opportunities for higher education, students, faculty, and even the nation-state. Nonetheless, evidence of educational restrictions, encumbered actions, and archaic approaches pervades the legal literature and case law demonstrating that these laws and policies do not always function well in evolving and emerging technology spaces. To examine these laws and policies of student privacy, the author employs the combination of a critical policy analysis, which derives from critical social research as a means to explore discourse and policy through drawing out the policy contexts, texts, and consequences, and Flood's liberating systems theory, which directs the analysis to a problem-solving approach by examining the policy discourse from a systems-thinking lens. Based on a review of 184 court cases, 74 policies from a diversified representation of US states/territories, and seven developed nations or multi-nation consortia, this examination illuminates how context and text such as the type and setting of the privacy matter (eg, various freedom of information acts, educational records under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, and General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union) presents opportunities for protections and standardization efforts; however, they also illustrate significant protection gaps, guesswork and insufficiency around the type and degree of data subject consent, and ghosting effects of data subjects' protections. While the extant literature already supports aspects of these findings, it does not account for this holistic view of these three privacy vulnerabilities—especially in light of the principles to which these laws purport to achieve. Moreover, the three identified privacy vulnerabilities suggest overlooked inclusion of two overarching privacy concepts—transparency and equity. This study recommends that key actors in the policy construction realm (ie, university leaders, policymakers, and judges) should engage in analyses, dialogue, and consideration about transparency and equity by considering contemporary privacy problems in the contexts of artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and cybersecurity as a way to improve transparent and equitable policies in these areas rather than exacerbating the privacy dilemmas already in place. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic In the United States, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) are well documented evidence of privacy protections for education and health records, but they fail to offer sufficient protections for students as data subjects with emerging technologies. Existing federal-level laws in the United States do not offer a systematic or uniform approach in the manner that data users obtain consent, so data subjects are largely unaware of what is being consented. Other than matters of consent, policy strategies based on student privacy laws (ie, voluntary consensus standards, basic practices to maintain privacy, an ethics review board, data/record retention and destruction, and data sanitation of equipment) are significant and informative largely from the university-perspective, not the students as data subjects. What this paper adds A new comprehensive examination of US laws including statutes, regulations, and cases as well as seven key nation-state or national consortia laws—especially the EU's General Data Protection Regulation and selected state laws in the United States, which offer consistent and greater student privacy protections. Insights about the principles designed among the laws, which centre around their application, essentiality, consent, and security. Attention to areas in which student privacy laws still present privacy concerns, but specifically identifying issues of significant gaps, guesswork and insufficiency around levels and types of consent, and ghosting effects of data subjects' protections. Implications for practice and/or policy Data subject consent should be established and consistent– whether an opt-out provision, opt-in provision, or some extensive engagement. Student privacy policies should incorporate principles of transparency and equity for data subjects and data treatment. Policymakers should consider now how the intersections of data subject privacy matters shall be addressed in the context of artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and cybersecurity. © 2023 British Educational Research Association.",critical policy analysis;

The development of advanced metering and control infrastructure ensures a growth in the amount of data transferred within smart grids. Data compression is a strategy to reduce the burden. This paper presents current challenges in the field of time-series data compression. This paper’s novel contribution is the division of data in smart grids to real-time data used for control purposes and big data sets used for non-time-critical analysis of the system. Both of these two applications have different requirements for effective compression. Currently used algorithms are listed and described with their advantages and drawbacks for both of these applications. Details needed for the implementation of an algorithm were also provided. Comprehensive analysis and comparison are intended to facilitate the design of a data compression method tailored for a particular application. An important contribution is the description of the influence of data compression methods on cybersecurity, which is one of the major concerns in modern power grids. Future work includes the development of adaptive compression methods based on artificial intelligence, especially machine learning and quantum computing. This review will offer a solid foundation for the research and design of data compression methods. © 2023 by the authors.",big data; communication in power grids; cybersecurity; data compression; information theory; Internet of Things; real-time operating systems; signal processing; smart grid,Big data; Computation theory; Computer control systems; Computer operating systems; Data compression; Electric power system control; Embedded systems; Internet of things; Quantum computers; Real time control; Communication in power grid; Compression methods; Compression techniques; Cyber security; Power grids; Real-time control; Real.time operating system; Signal-processing; Smart grid; Time-critical; Smart power grids,,,,"Kamwa I., Dynamic Wide Area Situational Awareness: Propelling Future Decentralized, Decarbonized, Digitized, and Democratized Electricity Grids, IEEE Power Energy Mag, 21, pp. 44-58, (2023); Dileep G., A survey on smart grid technologies and applications, Renew.

Our analysis is centered around the role of non-Gaussianity in mitigating the excess noise arising due to the mismatch between the signal modes and the local oscillators used for measurements. To be specific, we consider the non-Gaussian resources generated by single-photon subtraction and zero-photon catalysis applied on a two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV) state. We show that, at a given strength of the mode-mismatch noise, zero-photon catalysis leads to the maximum transmission distance, compared to the TMSV. However, considering the unavoidable issue of photon loss in the linear optical scheme for implementing zero-photon catalysis, our results hints at the single-photon-subtracted TMSV being the optimal choice for maximizing the transmission distance in EB CV QKD.  © 2023 American Physical Society.

Recently, a general new framework called the reference technique has attracted wide attention in defending against the imperfect sources of quantum key distribution. Here, the state preparation flaws, the side channels of mode dependencies, the Trojan horse attacks, and the pulse classical correlations are studied by using the reference technique on the phase-matching protocol. Our simulation results highlight the importance of the actual secure parameters choice for transmitters, which is necessary to achieve secure communication. Increasing the single actual secure parameter will reduce the secure key rate. However, as long as the parameters are set properly, the secure key rate is still high. Considering the influences of multiple actual secure parameters will significantly reduce the secure key rate. These actual secure parameters must be considered when scientists calibrate transmitters. This work is an important step towards the practical and secure implementation of phase-matching protocol. In the future, it is essential to study the main parameters, find out their maximum and general values, classify the multiple parameters as the same parameter, and give countermeasures. © 2023 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.",imperfect sources; phase-matching; quantum key distribution; reference technique,Malware; Network security; Phase matching; Quantum cryptography; Side channel attack; Classical correlation; Imperfect source; Main parameters; Parameter choice; Phase-matching; Reference technique; Secure implementation; Side-channel; State preparation; Trojan Horse attacks; Transmitters,,"Anhui Initiative in Quantum Information Technologies; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62101597); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2021M691536); Natural Science Foundation of Henan Province, (202300410532, 202300410534); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2020YFA0309701, 2020YFA0309702)","Project supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant Nos. 2020YFA0309702 and 2020YFA0309701), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 62101597), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2021M691536), the Natural Science Foundation of Henan (Grant Nos. 202300410534 and 202300410532), and the Anhui Initiative in Quantum Information Technologies.","Liu Y, Chen T Y, Wang L J, Liang H, Shentu G L, Wang J, Cui K, Yin H L, Liu N L, Li L, Ma X, Pelc J S, Fejer M M, Peng C Z, Zhang Q, Pan J W, Phys.

The distinct transition from connected things in 5G URLLC networks to connected intelligence in 6G URLLC networks requires ultra-secure communication due to the massive amount of private data. However, it is a challenging task to ensure stringent 6G URLLC requirements along with user privacy and data security in distributed networks. In this paper, we devise a distributed quantum computation protocol to perform a nonlocal controlled unitary operation on a bipartite input state in concealed and counterfactual manner and integrate it with anonymous quantum communication networks. This distributed protocol allows Bob to apply an arbitrary singlequbit unitary operator on Alice's qubit in a controlled and probabilistic fashion, without revealing the operator to her and without transmitting any physical particle over the quantum channel-called the counterfactual concealed telecomputation (CCT). It is shown that the CCT protocol neither requires the preshared entanglement nor depends on the bipartite input state and that the single-qubit unitary teleportation is a special case of CCT. The quantum circuit for CCT can be implemented using the (chained) quantum Zeno gates. The protocol becomes deterministic with simplified circuit implementation if the initial composite state of Alice and Bob is a Bell-type state. Furthermore, we provide numerical examples of quantum anonymous broadcast networks using the CCT protocol and show their degrees of anonymity in the presence of malicious users.  © 1983-2012 IEEE.",6G; blind quantum computation; counterfactual quantum communication; distributed learning; quantum anonymous networks; ultra-reliable and low-latency communication,5G mobile communication systems; Computation theory; Internet protocols; Logic gates; Network security; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Quantum entanglement; 6g; 6g mobile communication; Anonymous Networks; Blind quantum computation; Counterfactual quantum communication; Counterfactuals; Distributed learning; Low-latency communication; Mobile communications; Quantum anonymous network; Quantum Computing; Ultra reliable low latency communication; Ultra-reliable and low-latency communication; Quantum communication,,"Institute for Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation; National Science Foundation, NSF, (CCF-2153230); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (IITP-2021-0-02046); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (2019R1A2C2007037, 2022R1A4A3033401)","The fundamental research described in this paper was supported in part by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIT) (No. 2019R1A2C2007037 and 2022R1A4A3033401), by the MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT), Korea, under the ITRC (Information Technology Research Center) support program (IITP-2021-0-02046) supervised by the IITP (Institute for Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation) and in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant CCF-2153230.","Park J., Et al., Extreme ultra-reliable and low-latency communication, Nature Electron, 5, 3, pp. 133-141, (2022); She C., Et al., A tutorial on ultrareliable and low-latency communications in 6G: Integrating domain knowledge into deep learning, Proc.

When it comes to cybersecurity, one of the key benefits of using machine learning is that it makes the detection of malware more effective, scalable, and actionable than traditional human approaches. This is one of the primary advantages of employing machine learning. The cybersecurity risks posed by quantum learning must be effectively managed on a logical and theoretical level in order to be mitigated. It is necessary to prevail over these obstacles. Deep learning, support vector quantums, and Bayesian classification are just a few examples of the quantum learning and statistical technologies that have showed promise in the area of reducing the consequences of cyberattacks. When designing intelligent security systems, it is essential to unearth previously unknown patterns and insights hidden within network data, as well as to develop a data-driven quantum learning model to counteract the threats posed by these attacks. Additionally, it is essential to uncover previously unknown patterns and insights hidden within network data. The chapter develops AI-based modeling to improve the detection of cybersecurity attacks in Internet of Things--Software-Defined Network (IoT-SDN). The collection of network logs, preprocessing, and classification of instances enables the model to classify the attacks from the network. The simulation is conducted in Python to test the effectiveness of the AI-driven model. The results show that the proposed method achieves higher rate of accuracy in detecting the instances than other methods. © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

In this paper, we propose the one-sided measurement-device-independent quantum secure direct communication (1SMDI-QSDC) protocol, which not only has the advantage of being independent of detection loopholes but also weakens the requirement of MDI-QSDC for state preparation. We analyze the real-life secrecy capacity of this proposed protocol by using realistic experimental settings that contain the weak coherent pulse source, parametric down-conversion source, and customized decoy-state method. The results indicate that our protocols can achieve secure communication over a few hundred kilometers. Furthermore, we find that the coding technology of increasing capacity using masking (INCUM) can mitigate the degradation of the maximum distance of secure communication when the state preparation is highly untrustworthy.  © 1983-2012 IEEE.",decoy-state method; measurement-device-independent; Quantum communication; quantum secure direct communication; secrecy capacity,Quantum communication; Quantum cryptography; Secure communication; Signal encoding; Decoy state; Decoy-state method; Encodings; Measurement device; Measurement-device-independent; Quantum secure direct communication; Quantum state; Secrecy capacity; Security; State preparation; Quantum entanglement,,"Key R&D Program of Guangdong province, (2018B030325002); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11974205, 12205011); Tsinghua University, THU; State Key Laboratory of Low-Dimensional Quantum Physics, SKLLDQP, (KF202205); Beijing Innovation Center for Future Chip, ICFC","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 11974205 and 12205011, in part by the Key R&D Program of Guangdong province under Grant 2018B030325002, and in part by the Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Future Chip (ICFC), Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program.

Secondly, extend the protocol to multiple parties and consider attempting to establish an objective function for success probability when the initial resource is not the maximum quantum entangled state. Finally, we reconstruct the encryption and decryption processes in non-maximally entangled GHZ states. The research shows that this group of protocols is theoretically feasible in the infinite dimensional space, and confirms the advantages of high-dimensional entanglement, such as high channel capacity and strong anti-eavesdropping ability, which provides a good theoretical basis for in-depth research of high-dimensional entanglement in the field of quantum information. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Dense coding;

However, nonreciprocal router with multiaccess channels has not been extensively studied yet. Here, we propose a nonreciprocal router with one transmitter, one receiver, and two output terminals, based on an optomechanical plaquette composing of two optical modes and two mechanical modes. The time-reversal symmetry of the system is broken via synthetic magnetism induced by driving the two optical modes with phase-correlated laser fields. The prerequisites for nonreciprocal routing are obtained both analytically and numerically, and the robustness of the nonreciprocity is demonstrated numerically. Multiterminal nonreciprocal router in optomechanical plaquette provides a useful quantum node for development of quantum network information security and realization of quantum secure communication. © 2023 The Author(s).

The quantum-based internet is predicted to be more secure than the classical one due to its entanglement distribution strategy. The main challenge that can face the quantum internet is the nature of quantum bits which require special circumstances to stay stable. Quantum bit entanglement is fragile and decoherence which leads to missing the entangled photons and disconnection of communication. Recently, different solutions have been suggested to overcome this challenge which are mainly counting on the technologies and materials that can increase the photon lifetime and enhance the ability to transfer it over long distances without losses. In this paper a general overview of this new and interesting research topic is presented which can be considered as an onset for the researchers who are interested in this promising field. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc..

This indicates that classical cryptography, such as asymmetric ciphers based on complex mathematics, faces a significant threat from quantum algorithms. However, quantum cryptography can detect any attempt to eavesdrop on a channel. As a result, the investigation and implementation of quantum computers and quantum-secure communication networks have become essential objectives for numerous research teams. This paper provides an overview of quantum cryptography, including its development, and focuses on the theoretical aspect of quantum secure direct communication (QSDC). This helps readers understand the theoretical operating principles and gain a better understanding of the entire quantum characteristic and protocol operation in the QSDC field. QSDC enables secure communication without previously shared private keys, making it a crucial topic in quantum cryptography research. This paper provides an overview of several well-known versions of QSDC in theory, discussing their applications, challenges and potential future directions.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.",quantum cryptography; quantum key distribution; Quantum secure direct communication,,,,,"Qi Z., Li Y., Huang Y., Feng J., Zheng Y., Chen X., Light Sci.

Quantum computing is an emerging technology that can perform these tasks. Any computational issue that can be resolved by a classical computer can also be resolved more effectively by a quantum computer. Out of all of these problem areas, network security is one where quantum computing is most directly related, with key management and distribution being its two main applications that are used in a variety of ways. The principles of quantum computing, as well as several key distribution strategies based on quantum computing, are briefly explained in this study. Moreover, this article focuses on computational engineering applications of quantum computing as well. Future dangers to data security and privacy have arisen as a result of the official announcement of ""quantum supremacy"" by Google. Future risks to all IT-dependent applications, including but not limited to smart cities, power distribution, and military applications, must be one of our main areas of focus (especially critical infrastructure). The study's goal is to raise public awareness of the present and foreseeable risks to data security and privacy posed by potential quantum applications. The article primarily demonstrates how PKI and its key exchange mechanism may be readily broken with the aid of quantum computers and also suggests a solution to make our key exchange protocol secure, utilizing QKD, which guarantees a secure key exchange between the sender and the intended recipient.

However, generating truly random numbers can be elusive. Pseudorandom bit generation using computer algorithms provides a high random bit generation rate. Nevertheless, the reliance on predefined algorithms makes it deterministic and predictable once initial conditions are known. Relying on physical phenomena (such as measuring electrical noise or even rolling dice) can achieve a less predictable sequence of bits. Furthermore, if the physical phenomena originate from quantum effects, they can be truly random and completely unpredictable due to quantum indeterminacy. Traditionally, physical RNG is significantly slower than pseudorandom techniques. To meet the demand for high-speed RNG with perfect unpredictability, semiconductor light sources are adopted as parts of the sources of randomness, i.e., entropy sources, in quantum RNG (QRNG) systems. The high speed of their noise, the high efficiency, and the small scale of these devices make them ideal for chip-scale QRNG. Here, the applications and recent advances of QRNG are reviewed using semiconductor emitters. Finally, the performance of these emitters is compared and discuss their potential in future technologies. © 2023 The Authors.

They were secure against a variety of attacks, including eavesdropping, signatory disavowal, verifier denial, and forgery. The protocol worked by using quantum entanglement to create a shared secret state between the security service bases. This shared secret state was then used to generate a quantum signature for each message sent between the bases. The signature was then verified by the receiving base using the shared secret state. Compared to classical blind signature schemes, the main advantages of the quantum entanglement-based quantum blind signature protocol were its information-theoretic security and reduced complexity and noise. However, this protocol also faced some challenges, such as preparing and storing entangled states, performing quantum operations and measurements, and ensuring the trustworthiness of the third party. Despite these challenges, the quantum entanglement-based quantum blind signature protocol was a promising new technology for secure communication between security service like military bases. It had the potential to revolutionize the way that military bases communicated with each other, making it possible to send secure messages without revealing the content or identity of the messages.  © 2023 ACM.",Challenges; Entanglement-Based Quantum Blind Signature Protocol; Information-Theoretic Security; Quantum Teleportation; Reduced Complexity and Noise; Secure Communication,Authentication; Information theory; Network security; Quantum communication; Quantum cryptography; Quantum entanglement; Blind signatures; Challenge; Entanglement-based quantum blind signature protocol; Information- theoretic securities; Military base; Quantum teleportation; Reduced complexity and noise; Reduced-complexity; Security services; Shared secrets; Secure communication,,"Ministry of Electronics and Information technology, Meity; Amazon Braket India","This Research work is supported by the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology (MeitY) Quantum Computing Applications Lab (QCAL), Amazon Braket India.","Kalaivani V., Enhanced BB84 quantum cryptography protocol for secure communication in wireless body sensor networks for medical applications, Personal and Ubiquitous Computing, 27, 3, (2023); Reutov A., Tayduganov A., Mayboroda V., Fat'Yanov O., Security of the decoy-state BB84 protocol with imperfect state preparation, (2023); Allevi A., Molteni F., Zambelli S., Bondani M., Optimizing the propagation of mesoscopic twin-beam states for novel Quantum Communication protocols, International Journal of Quantum Information, (2023); Choudhury B.S., Mandal M.K., Samanta S., Dolai B., A bidirectional hybrid quantum communication scheme for a known and an unknown qubit, Quantum Studies: Mathematics and Foundations, 10, 1, pp. 89-99, (2023); Zhou L., Lin J., Xie Y.M., Lu Y.S., Jing Y., Yin H.L., Yuan Z., Experimental quantum communication overcomes the rate-loss limit without global phase tracking, Physical Review Letters, 130, 25, (2023); Caleffi M., Simonov K., Cacciapuoti A.S., Beyond Shannon Limits: Quantum Communications through Quantum Paths, IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, (2023); Mitra A., Badhani H., Ghosh S., Improvement in quantum communication using quantum switch, Physica Scripta, 98, 4, (2023); Klein J.W., Bastian B., The fusion-secure base hypothesis, Personality and Social Psychology Review, 27, 2, pp. 107-127, (2023); Li C., Jiang B., Guo Y., Xin X., Efficient Group Blind Signature for Medical Data Anonymous Authentication in Blockchain-Enabled IoMT, Computers, Materials & Continua, 76, 1, (2023); Do K., Hanzlik L., Paracucchi E., M&M'S: Mix and Match Attacks on Schnorr-type Blind Signatures with Repetition, Cryptology ePrint Archive, (2023); Deng Z.M., Lu D.J., Chen T., Mou H.J., Wei X.J., Quantum (t, m, n) Threshold Group Blind Signature Scheme with Flexible Number of Participants, International Journal of Theoretical Physics, 62, 9, (2023); Klein J.W., Bastian B., The fusion-secure base hypothesis, Personality and Social Psychology Review, 27, 2, pp. 107-127, (2023); Pereira M., Curras-Lorenzo G., Navarrete A., Mizutani A., Kato G., Curty M., Tamaki K., Modified BB84 quantum key distribution protocol robust to source imperfections, Physical Review Research, 5, 2, (2023); Kong P.Y., Challenges of Routing in Quantum Key Distribution Networks with Trusted Nodes for Key Relaying, IEEE Communications Magazine, (2023); Wei J.I.A., Qiangqiang Z.H.A.N.G., Yuxiang B.I.A.N., Wei L.I., Research on the upper bound of collective attack in E91-QKD, Chinese Journal of Quantum Electronics, 40, 3, (2023); Zhao W., Wang F.Q., Mao Y.Y., Zhong H., Ding C., Ruan X.C., Teleportation-based continuous-variable quantum digital signature, Results in Physics, (2023); Zhang Z., You C., Magana-Loaiza O.S., Fickler R., Leon-Montiel R.D.J., Torres J.P., Humble T., Liu S., Xia Y., Zhuang Q., Entanglement-Based Quantum Information Technology, (2023); Deng Z.M., Lu D.J., Chen T., Mou H.J., Wei X.J., Quantum (t, m, n) Threshold Group Blind Signature Scheme with Flexible Number of Participants, International Journal of Theoretical Physics, 62, 9, (2023)","G.

The study of quantum computing focuses on finding new ways to compute by utilizing quantum physics phenomena. A qubit, in contrast to a typical computer bit, can be either 0 or 1, or it can be a superposition of both 0 and 1. Quantum theory serving as the base to operate supercomputers is based on two aspects of quantum physics: superposition and entanglement.

The quantum noise from vacuum fluctuations is acquired by balanced homodyne detection and injected into a phase modulator to form a random phase feedback. An optical switch using high-speed intensity modulator is employed to reset the chaotic states repeatedly and the time evolutions of intensity statistical distributions of the chaotic states stemming from the initial noise are measured. By the quantum-noise random phase feedback, the transient intensity distributions of the chaotic outputs are improved from asymmetric invariant distributions to Gaussian invariant distributions, and the Gaussian invariant distribution indicates a randomly perturbed dynamical transition from microscopic initial noise to macroscopic stochastic fluctuation. The effects of phase feedback bandwidth and modulation depth on the invariant distributions are investigated experimentally. The chaotic time-delay signature and mean permutation entropy are suppressed to 0.036 and enhanced to 0.999 using the random phase feedback, respectively. The high-quality chaotic laser with Gaussian invariant distribution can be a desired random source for ultrafast random number generation and secure communication.  © 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement.",,Gaussian distribution; Light modulators; Quantum cryptography; Quantum theory; Random number generation; Stochastic systems; Balanced homodyne detection; Chaotic lasers; Chaotic state; Feed-back based; Gaussians; Invariant distribution; Phase feedback; Phase modulator; Random-phase; Vacuum fluctuations; Quantum noise,,"FP7 International Cooperation, INCO, (201903D421049); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62075154, 62175176); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2022YFA1404201); Shanxi Provincial Key Research and Development Project","Funding.

Traditionally, optical transmitters are able to either produce phase-controlled pulses at a fixed wavelength or require a chain of bulky and expensive external modulators to convert wavelength tunable continuous-wave light into optical pulses. One technology of great interest is quantum key distribution (QKD), a technology for generating perfectly random keys at remote nodes to ensure secure communications. Environments such as data centers, where the user needs change regularly, will require adaptability in the deployment of QKD to integrate into classical optical networks. Here we propose and demonstrate an alternative quantum transmitter design consisting of a multimodal Fabry-Perot laser optically injection locked by a wavelength tunable laser. The transmitter is able to produce phase-controlled optical pulses at GHz speeds with a tunable wavelength range of >65nm centered at 1550 nm. With this transmitter, we perform proof-of-principle QKD with secure bit rates of order Mb/s.  © 2023 American Physical Society. Published by the American Physical Society.

First, a feature fingerprint construction method based on reconfigured phase space of optical chaos is proposed. Then the fingerprint is controlled by the feedback intensity and filtering bandwidth of chaos. The in-phase and quadrature-phase encryption (IQE)/decryption (IQD) ensures the loading of fingerprints and realizes the confidential communication. In the experiment, the recognition rate of three transmitters is up to 99.3%. In the simulation, the recognition rate of five optical transmitters reaches 100% after 600 km transmission. The bit error rate of 25 GBaud QPSK signal after 300 km transmission at 25 dB OSNR is 1.6 × 10−3. Compared with the traditional optical transmitter identification methods, the fingerprint of this scheme is controllable. The IQE and IQD not only realize the chaotic fingerprint loading but also ensure the secure transmission of the signal avoiding the synchronization and time delay exposure problems in traditional chaotic communication systems. It is robust to device parameters, with low implementation difficulty and low cost. Therefore, this scheme has research and application value for secure communication in the physical layer of optical networks. © 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement.",,Fiber optic networks; Network layers; Network security; Optical communication; Optical systems; Optical transmitters; Palmprint recognition; Phase space methods; Quantum cryptography; Chaotics; Construction method; Identification scheme; In-phase and quadrature-phase; Optical-; Phase encryption; Phase space reconfiguration; Physical layers; Target injection; Transmitter identification; article; bandwidth; encryption; filtration; simulation; Bit error rate,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61831003, 62021005)","National Natural Science Foundation of China (61831003, 62021005).","Li Y., Hua N., Li J., Zhong Z., Li S., Zhao C., Xue X., Zheng X., Optical spectrum feature analysis and recognition for optical network security with machine learning, Opt.

However, there is a significant concern regarding the potential misuse of this technology. Moreover, the current research on identifying malicious quantum steganography is insufficient. To address this gap in steganalysis research, this paper proposes a specialized quantum steganalysis algorithm. This algorithm utilizes quantum machine learning techniques to detect steganography in general quantum secure communication schemes that are based on pure states. The algorithm presented in this paper consists of two main steps: data preprocessing and automatic discrimination. The data preprocessing step involves extracting and amplifying abnormal signals, followed by the automatic detection of suspicious quantum carriers through training on steganographic and non-steganographic data. The numerical results demonstrate that a larger disparity between the probability distributions of steganographic and non-steganographic data leads to a higher steganographic detection indicator, making the presence of steganography easier to detect. By selecting an appropriate threshold value, the steganography detection rate can exceed 90%.

Currently, governments and businesses employ PKI for many core processes that may become insecure or unavailable when quantum computers break the cryptographic algorithms foundational to PKI. While standardization institutes are currently testing quantum safe cryptographic algorithms, there are no globally agreed-upon cryptographic solutions available. Actors looking to prepare for the implementation of quantum safe cryptographic algorithms lack methods that allow for collective planning and action across organizations, sectors, and nations. The goal of this policy paper is to elicit requirements for a serious game on QS PKI, and derive policy guidelines that actors can use to prepare and formulate governance arrangements. We followed a two-step approach, drawing on technology threat avoidance theory and collective action theory, followed by empirical grounding through a focus group. The results from the literature confirm that a serious game could be a suitable governance mechanism for QS PKI. The focus group results discussed 12 requirements and the requirement's relation to the theoretical background. From this, the findings section arrived at four policy guidelines derived from the requirements that can function as focus areas for further requirement development and as input for policy makers. The policy guidelines concluded are (1) prioritize increasing collective awareness through emphasizing social networks, (2) acknowledge the interdependencies in migrating towards QS PKI, (3) create an understanding of the technical standards in the field and their issuers, and (4) being highly realistic with both negative and positive scenarios to center the players' understanding of real-world impact. © 2023 Owner/Author.",Collective action; Cybersecurity; Policy; Quantum-Safe PKI; Serious Games,Cybersecurity; Public key cryptography; Public policy; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Collective action; Cryptographic algorithms; Cyber security; Focus groups; Information exchanges; Many-core; Public key infrastructure; Public key infrastructure systems; Quanta computers; Quantum-safe public key infrastructure; Serious games,,"Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO","This research for this paper was funded by the HAPKIDO project as a part of their Governance Track with project number NWA.1215.18.002, partly financed by the Dutch Research Council (NWO).","Arachchilage N.A.G., Hameed M.A., Integrating self-efficacy into a gamified approach to thwart phishing attacks, (2017); Backlund P., Et al., Designing for Self-Efficacy in a Game Based Simulator: An Experimental Study and Its Implications for Serious Games Design, 2008 International Conference Visualisation, pp. 106-113, (2008); Blasko-Drabik H., Et al., Investigating the Impact of Self-Efficacy in Learning Disaster Strategies in an On-Line Serious Game, Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting, 57, 1, pp. 1455-1459, (2013); Bourazeri A., Pitt J., Collective Awareness for Collective Action in Sociotechnical Systems, 2014 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems Workshops, pp. 90-95, (2014); Chittaro L., Sioni R., Serious games for emergency preparedness: Evaluation of an interactive vs. A non-interactive simulation of a terror attack, Computers in Human Behavior., 50, pp. 508-519, (2015); Dejean S., Et al., Olson's Paradox Revisited: An Empirical Analysis of incentives to contribute in P2P File-Sharing Communities, SSRN Electronic Journal, (2010); Duke R.D., Geurts J.L.A., Policy games for strategic management: Pathways into the unknown, (2004); Grimes R.A., Cryptography apocalypse: Preparing for the day when quantum computing breaks today's crypto, (2019); Joseph D., Et al., Transitioning organizations to post-quantum cryptography, Nature, 605, 7909, pp. 237-243, (2022); Kong I., Et al., Challenges in the Transition towards a Quantum-safe Government, DG.

We present a robust protocol for generating remote entanglement, specifically W states, among multiple nonlocal superconducting qubits. Our protocol employs practical microwave pulse scattering through a microwave cavity, which is coupled to a far-detuned superconducting transmon qubit, facilitating a CNOT-like operation. Our approach can be implemented without the need for single microwave-photon sources and its completion is heralded by microwave photon measurements. Furthermore, our protocol can generate faithful nonlocal W states of distant superconducting qubits with practical detector units, each cascading two quantum non-demolition detectors, rather than ideal single-photon detectors. These distinct features make our protocol particularly useful for large quantum secure communication networks. © 2023 Author(s).",,Particle beams; Quantum cryptography; Quantum entanglement; Fundamental physics; Microwave cavity; Microwave photon; Microwave pulse; Multipartite entanglements; Nonlocal; Robust protocol; State generations; Superconducting qubits; W state; Photons,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11904171, 62221004); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (30922010807)",We thank Professor Keyu Xia for helpful discussions.

Here, to our best knowledge, we demonstrate the first experimental continuous variable quantum key distribution with an entanglement source between the two users. We consider a practical partially characterized entangled source and establish the security analysis model of the protocol under realistic conditions. By applying a biased base technology, the higher key rate than that of the original protocol is achieved. The experimental results demonstrate that the distance between two users can reach up to 60 km over telecom single-mode fiber, implying the feasibility for high-rate and secure communication with a shared entangled source at metropolitan distances. © 2023 Chinese Laser Press.",,Quantum efficiency; Quantum entanglement; Single mode fibers; Analysis models; Continuous variables; Homodyne detector; Low-costs; Quantum network; Quantum resources; Realistic conditions; Relay node; Security analysis; Simple++; Quantum cryptography,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62175138); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (1331KSC, 2016YFA0301403)",Funding.

The insufficiency of classic phishing detection tools has become apparent as fraudsters continue to develop new strategies; these approaches mostly depend on variables such as URL character sequences, site content, and visual resemblance. The present study highlights the ""Zérosdetect"" approach, a quantum-powered technique for detecting phishing URLs using zero-shot learning, a robust model that makes use of both the zero-shot learning's adaptability and the computational advantageous nature of quantum computing, it mitigates the need for extensive previous knowledge of phishing URL attributes. In order to detect previously undiscovered phishing attacks, quantum neural network have been deployed to convert URL data into quantum spaces, therefore using the computational benefits of quantum systems. Quantum layers embedded inside Qnodes are a key part of the present system, calculating gradients at a faster pace, optimizing the network performance by rapidly calculating gradients, making the solution both efficient and forward-thinking. The present study lays the groundwork for future cybersecurity initiatives in the era of quantum computing, enhancing the potential to predict new cases of phishing. © 2023 IEEE.",Cybersecurity frameworks; Natural Language Processing; Quantum Computing; Quantum Language Models; Zero-Shot Learning,Computer crime; Data handling; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Zero-shot learning; Confidential information; Cyber security; Cybersecurity framework; Language model; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Phishing; Quantum Computing; Quantum language model; Learning systems,,,,"Vedral V., Introduction to Quantum Information Science, (2006); Horodecki R., Horodecki P., Horodecki M., Horodecki K., Quantum entanglement, Reviews of Modern Physics, 81, 2, pp. 865-942, (2009); Shor P.W., Algorithms for quantum computation: discrete logarithms and factoring, Proceedings 35th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science; Grover L.K., A fast quantum mechanical algorithm for database search, Proceedings of the twenty-eighth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing - STOC'96, (1996); Biamonte J., Wittek P., Pancotti N., Rebentrost P., Wiebe N., Lloyd S., Quantum machine learning, Nature, 549, 7671, pp. 195-202, (2017); Schuld M., Sinayskiy I., Petruccione F., An introduction to quantum machine learning, Contemporary Physics, 56, 2, pp. 172-185, (2014); Nielsen M.A., Chuang I.L., Quantum Computation and Quantum Information, (2012); Chen Y., Pan Y., Dong D., Quantum Language Model With Entanglement Embedding for Question Answering, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 53, 6, pp. 3467-3478, (2023); Li Q., Uprety S., Wang B., Song D., Quantum-Inspired Complex Word Embedding, Proceedings of The Third Workshop on Representation Learning for NLP, (2018); Kumar Y., Verma S.K., Sharma S., Quantum-inspired binary gravitational search algorithm to recognize the facial expressions, International Journal of Modern Physics C, 31, 10, (2020); Lai W., Shi J., Chang Y., Quantum-Inspired Fully Complex-Valued Neutral Network for Sentiment Analysis, Axioms, 12, 3, (2023); Xian Y., Lampert C.H., Schiele B., Akata Z., Zero-Shot Learning-A Comprehensive Evaluation of the Good, the Bad and the Ugly, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 41, 9, pp. 2251-2265, (2019); Somesha M., Pais A.R., Rao R.S., Rathour V.S., Efficient deep learning techniques for the detection of phishing websites, Sādhanā, 45, 1, (2020); Aljofey A., Et al., An effective detection approach for phishing websites using URL and HTML features, Scientific Reports, 12, 1, (2022); Sarhan M., Layeghy S., Gallagher M., Portmann M., From zero-shot machine learning to zero-day attack detection, International Journal of Information Security, 22, 4, pp. 947-959, (2023); Wang W., Zheng V.W., Yu H., Miao C., A Survey of Zero-Shot Learning, ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, 10, 2, pp. 1-37, (2019); Di Pierro A., Incudini M., Quantum Machine Learning and Fraud Detection, Protocols, Strands, and Logic, pp. 139-155, (2021); Aldakheel E.A., Zakariah M., Gashgari G.A., Almarshad F.A., Alzahrani A.I.A., A Deep Learning-Based Innovative Technique for Phishing Detection in Modern Security with Uniform Resource Locators, Sensors, 23, 9, (2023); Boneh D., Zhandry M., Quantum-Secure Message Authentication Codes, Advances in Cryptology - EUROCRYPT 2013, pp. 592-608, (2013); Dunjko V., Taylor J.M., Briegel H.J., Quantum-Enhanced Machine Learning, Physical Review Letters, 117, 13, (2016); Marchal S., Francois J., State R., Engel T., PhishStorm: Detecting Phishing With Streaming Analytics, IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management, 11, 4, pp. 458-471, (2014)",,Mohan J.; Chaturvedi B.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"9th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication, ICSC 2023",21 December 2023 through 23 December 2023,Noida,197666.0,,979-835038320-1,,,English,"Int.

With this knowledge, cryptologists should be able to create post-quantum symmetric ciphers by incorporating these new quantum cryptanalysis techniques into their toolkit. Secure communication is crucial for applications related to the Internet of Things (IoT) to avoid cyberattacks. Cryptographic hash functions can be used to protect data integrity. The development of large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers is the most significant challenge. Recent techniques to attack symmetric key schemes can be achieved by using the Pre-image attack method, Simon’s algorithm, or by combining Simon’s and Grover’s algorithms. In this study, we explored some of the most recent methods for quantum cryptanalysis of symmetric key ciphers. Firstly, we discussed the design of quantum cryptanalysis methods, along with the advantages over classical procedures. In this paper, we illustrate the implementation of the NIST-standard lightweight hash function PHOTON-Beetle on a Quantum Computer (using IBM Qiskit), which is mostly used in IoT devices. Efficient quantum implementation of PHOTON-Beetle is proposed in this paper.

Today, quantum computers have been pitched to deliver the computing power necessary to solve computationally complex problems, that are currently thought to be difficult for classical computers. With the arrival of quantum machine learning algorithms, it has become important to explore unique methods of encoding and compressing data with qubits. In this paper, we will explore the possibility of linear bit-by-bit data compression in the state vector of a multi-qubit system. We will achieve this, by looking at a brief introduction to the topic, a possible way by which we could encode bits in a state vector and whether this system of encoding can be applied to a real time system. We will also elaborate on a possible application through a proposed protocol for secure communication, and suggest a further line of discussion on this topic.  © 2023 IEEE.",lossy quantum data compression; quantum algorithm; quantum encoding; secure communication,Data compression; Electric power transmission; Encoding (symbols); Interactive computer systems; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Real time systems; Signal encoding; Complex problems; Computing power; Encodings; ITS applications; Lossy quantum data compression; Quanta computers; Quantum algorithms; Quantum data compression; Quantum encoding; State vector; Digital storage,,,,"Lelewer D.A., Hirschberg D.S., Data compression, Acm Computing Surveys (CSUR, 19, 3, pp. 261-296, (1987); Salomon D., Data Compression, pp. 245-309, (2002); Hosseini M., A survey of data compression algorithms and their applications, Network Systems Laboratory, (2012); Blelloch G.E., Introduction to Data Compression, (2001); Seong S.W., Dictionary-based Code Compression Techniques Using Bit-masks for Embedded Systems, (2006); Ziv J., Lempel A., Compression of individual sequences via variable-rate coding, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 24, 5, pp. 530-536, (1978); Vinayak B., Sapkal A.M., Gaikwad M.S., The Role of Transforms in Image Compression, J.

Frequency saturation in Air Traffic Management (ATM) leads to communication problems, necessitating the enhancement of traditional systems. The Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) initiative, backed by the European Commission, aims to digitize ATM, with the L-band Digital Aeronautical Communications System (LDACS) as a key component. LDACS aims to improve communication, enhance surveillance, and optimize airspace usage for safer, more efficient ATM. Although LDACS is protected against most cyberattacks, a critical security objective, anonymity, is currently overlooked. To strengthen LDACS's security, robust authentication mechanisms, Post-Quantum security, and measures to ensure aircraft anonymity are crucial. Therefore, we propose a comprehensive security framework to enhance LDACS's cybersecurity, focusing on mutual authentication and key agreement. The protocol uses Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) for robust mutual authentication and Bit-flipping Key Encapsulation (BIKE) for secure session key establishment utilizing Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). This framework ensures anonymity and secure communication between aircraft and ground stations while minimizing message exchange, latency, and data overhead. An informal security analysis confirms our proposed framework's potential to augment the efficiency and security of ATM operations.  © 2023 IEEE.",Aviation Cybersecurity; BIKE; LDACS; Mutual Authentication and Key Exchange (MAKE); PUF,Advanced traffic management systems; Aircraft; Aircraft communication; Authentication; Aviation; Cybersecurity; Quantum cryptography; Aeronautical communications; Authentication and key exchange; Aviation cybersecurity; Bit flipping; Bit-flipping key encapsulation; Communications systems; Cyber security; L-band digital aeronautical communication system; Mutual authentication; Mutual authentication and key exchange; Air traffic control,,Trafikverket and Luftfartsverket,"This work was supported by Trafikverket and Luftfartsverket under Automation Program II.

The imperfections exhibited by non-ideal sources degrade the QKD performance. This raises the problem of engineering the employed quantum states to mitigate the impairments caused by such imperfections. This paper proposes to employ noisy photon-added squeezed states (PASSs) as QKD sources for the decoy-state protocol. First, noisy PASSs are characterized in the Fock space. Then, noisy PASSs are engineered for the decoy-state protocol. Finally, the performance of the decoy-state protocol with engineered noisy PASSs are quantified in a variety of settings.  © 2023 IEEE.",photon-added squeezed state; Quantum key distribution; quantum noise; quantum state engi-neering,Algebra; Quantum cryptography; Quantum noise; Quantum optics; Decoy-state protocol; Fock spaces; Non-ideal sources; Performance; Photon-added squeezed state; Quantum state; Quantum state engi-neering; Source engineering; Squeezed state; Unconditionally secure communications; Photons,,"MIT Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies; Office of Naval Research, ONR",ACKNOWLEDGMENT The fundamental research described in this paper was supported in part by the Office of Naval Research and in part by the MIT Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies.,"Bennett C.H., Brassard G., Quantum cryptography: Public key distribution and coin tossing, Proc.

To improve cost-efficiency, extensive research is being carried out on the various components required for high data throughput using quantum key distribution (QKD). Aiming for an application-oriented solution, we report the realization of a multichannel QKD system for plug-and-play high-bandwidth secure communication at telecom wavelengths. We designed a rack-sized multichannel superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD) system, as well as a highly parallelized time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) unit.

With the development of quantum technologies, many security mechanisms may be hacked due to the promising capabilities of quantum computation. To address this challenge, quantum protocols have emerged as a promising solution for enhancing the security of wireless sensor communications. One of the common types of quantum protocols is quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, which are investigated to allow two participants with fully quantum capabilities to share a random secret key, while semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) protocols are designed to perform the same task using fewer quantum resources to make quantum communications more realizable and practical. Quantum walk (QW) plays an essential role in quantum computing, which is a universal quantum computational paradigm. In this work, we utilize the advantages of QW to design three authenticated quantum cryptographic protocols to establish secure channels for data transmission between sensor nodes: the first one is authenticated quantum key distribution (AQKD), the second one is authenticated semi-quantum key distribution (ASQKD) with one of the two participants having limited quantum capabilities, and the last one is ASQKD but both legitimate users possess limited quantum resources. The advantages of the proposed protocols are that the partners can exchange several different keys with the same exchanged qubits, and the presented protocols depend on a one-way quantum communication channel. In contrast, all previously designed SQKD protocols rely on two-way quantum communication. Security analyses prove that the presented protocols are secure against various well-known attacks and highly efficient. The utilization of the presented protocols in wireless sensor communications opens up new avenues for secure and trustworthy data transmission, enabling the deployment of resilient WSNs in critical applications. This work also paves the way for future exploration of quantum-based security protocols and their integration into WSNs for enhanced data protection. © 2023 The Author(s).

At present, satellite based QKD is the only choice for distributing secure keys over larger distances, as fiber-based and terrestrial free-space systems have limited range. In this paper, the system engineering study and performance analysis for the satellite based QKD system is presented by carrying out the simulations for different orbits and orbital parameters. This work also presents the methodology to estimate the quantum keys generated for satellite to ground scenario across some of the suitable locations across Indian mainland. The orbital parameters of a LEO orbit are optimized to obtain a required accumulated key of more than 1 Mbits per day across all the ground stations. Two standard operating wavebands viz. 785 nm and 1550 nm, most suitable for quantum communication, are considered for both daylight and eclipse conditions and the difference in accesses, access gaps, access duration, key generation and key accumulation is obtained. A typical use-case scenario analysis for utilization of accumulated key over a year is also presented.  © 2023 IEEE.",Optical Ground Station (OGS); Quantum Communication; Satellite-to-Ground QKD; Secure key rate,Network security; Orbits; Quantum communication; Quantum theory; Satellite communication systems; Satellite ground stations; Satellites; Secure communication; Distribution architecture; Engineering methodology; Free spaces; Fundamental principles; Optical ground station; Orbital parameters; Satellite-to-ground quantum key distribution; Secure key rate; Space systems; Quantum cryptography,,,,"Bennett C.H., Brassard G., Quantum cryptography: Public key distribution and coin tossing, Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computers, Systems, and Signal Processing, (1984); Peng C.-Z., Et al., Experimental long-distance decoy-state quantum key distribution based on polarization encoding, Physical review letters, 98, 1, (2007); Lounis B., Orrit M., Single-photon sources, Reports on Progress in Physics, 68, 5, (2005); Liao S.-K., Et al., Satellite-to-ground quantum key distribution, Nature, 549, 7670, pp. 43-47, (2017); Takenaka H., Et al., Satellite-to-ground quantum-limited communication using a 50-kg-class microsatellite, Nature photonics, 11, 8, pp. 502-508, (2017); Bedington R., Arrazola J.M., Ling A., Progress in satellite quantum key distribution, npj Quantum Information., 3, 1, pp. 1-13, (2017); Jennewein T., Et al., QEYSSAT: A mission proposal for a quantum receiver in space, Advances in photonics of quantum computing, memory, and communication VII., 8997, (2014); Bourgoin J.P., Et al., A comprehensive design and performance analysis of low Earth orbit satellite quantum communication, New Journal of Physics, 15, 2, (2013); Liao S.-K., Et al., Long-distance free-space quantum key distribution in daylight towards inter-satellite communication, Nature Photonics, 11, 8, pp. 509-513, (2017); Jain A., Design and development of weak coherent pulse source for quantum key distribution system, 2020 IEEE CONECCT, pp. 1-5, (2020); Lo H.-K., Ma X., Chen K., Decoy State Quantum Key Distribution, Phys.

The algorithm uses a deep neural network to detect anomalous network traffic by analyzing features such as packet size, frequency, and time intervals. LHT provides a secure communication channel that is resistant to quantum attacks. The proposed algorithm achieves higher detection accuracy, lower false positive rates, and lower false negative rates than existing state-of-the-art intrusion detection systems. Our hybrid algorithm provides a balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, making it a practical solution for real-world wireless intrusion detection systems in a post-quantum era. Using a new and implementable post-quantum cryptography scheme and a deep neural network provides unique features and novelties to our proposed algorithm.  © 2023 IEEE.",Anomalous network traffic; Deep neural network; Machine learning; Post-quantum cryptography; Wireless intrusion detection systems,Computer crime; Deep neural networks; Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Quantum cryptography; Anomalous network traffic; Hybrid algorithms; Intrusion Detection Systems; Lattice-based; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Network traffic; Post quantum cryptography; Wireless intrusion detection system; Wireless intrusion detections; Economic and social effects,,,,"Murugeshwari B., Selvaraj D., Sudharson K., Radhika S., Data mining with privacy protection using precise elliptical curve cryptography, Intelligent Automation & Soft Computing, 35, 1, pp. 839-851, (2023); Murugeshwari B., Rajalakshmi S., Sudharson K., Hybrid approach for privacy enhancement in data mining using arbitrariness and perturbation, Computer Systems Science and Engineering, 44, 3, pp. 2293-2307, (2023); Chen J., Yu F., Leung V.C., Intrusion detection system based on k-means clustering for wireless sensor networks, IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, 14, 3, pp. 749-763, (2019); Dhinakaran D., Khanna M.R., Panimalar S.P., A.T.P, Kumar S.P., Sudharson K., Secure Android Location Tracking Application with Privacy Enhanced Technique, 2022 Fifth International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Technologies (CCICT), pp. 223-229, (2022); Sudharson K., Sermakani A.M., Parthipan V., Dhinakaran D., Eswari Petchiammal G., Usha N.S., Hybrid Deep Learning Neural System for Brain Tumor Detection, 2022 2nd International Conference on Intelligent Technologies (CONIT), pp. 1-6, (2022); Sudharson K., Alekhya B., Abinaya G., Rohini C., Arthi S., Dhinakaran D., Efficient Soil Condition Monitoring with IoT Enabled Intelligent Farming Solution, 2023 IEEE International Students' Conference on Electrical, Electronics and Computer Science (SCEECS), pp. 1-6, (2023); Sudharson K., Akshaya M., Lokeswari M., Gopika K., Secure Authentication scheme using CEEK technique for Trusted Environment, 2022 International Mobile and Embedded Technology Conference (MECON), pp. 66-71, (2022); Sudharson K., Arvindan R.R., Balashunmugham M., A Survey on AR-Based Digitization for Smart Education System, 2023 IEEE International Students' Conference on Electrical, Electronics and Computer Science (SCEECS), pp. 1-5, (2023); Sudharson K., Arun S., Security protocol function using quantum elliptic curve cryptography algorithm, Intelligent Automation & Soft Computing, 34, 3, pp. 1769-1784, (2022); Sudharson K., Mudassar Ali A., Partheeban N., NUITECH-Natural user interface technique foremulating computer hardware, International Journal of Pharmacy & Technology, 8, 4, pp. 23598-23606, (2016); Li X., Wang Y., Liu X., Liu L., A hybrid intrusion detection system for wireless networks based on decision tree algorithm and feature selection techniques, Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing, 11, 9, pp. 3965-3975, (2020); Li J., Xu C., Zhao Y., A decision tree-based intrusion detection system for wireless networks, Wireless Networks, 25, 6, pp. 3585-3597, (2019); Liu X., Wang Y., Li X., Liu L., Intrusion detection for wireless sensor networks using convolutional long short-term memory networks, Sensors, 20, 18, (2020); Liu J., Li Y., Lu W., A CNN-based intrusion detection system for wireless networks, 2019 International Conference on Communications, Information System and Computer Engineering (CISCE), pp. 9-12, (2019); Qiao X., Zhu X., Wang H., Zhou W., Lattice-based deep learning for wireless intrusion detection systems, Computer Networks, 196, (2021); Arun S., Sudharson K., DEFECT: Discover and eradicate fool around node in emergency network using combinatorial techniques, Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing, pp. 1-12, (2020); A Survey on Reader's Society: New Social Network of Book Swapping Platform, 2023 IEEE International Students' Conference on Electrical, Electronics and Computer Science (SCEECS), pp. 1-6, (2023); Pari S.N., Sudharson K., Hybrid trust based reputation mechanism for discovering malevolent node in manet, Computer Systems Science and Engineering, 44, 3, pp. 2775-2789, (2023); Neelavathy Pari S., Sudharson K., An enhanced trust-based secure route protocol for malicious node detection, Intelligent Automation & Soft Computing, 35, 2, pp. 2541-2554, (2023); Sudharson K., Balaji S., Deepak Reddy A., Sai Ram V., Speedy and Secure Remote Management Protocol Using Virtualization, International Conference on Innovative Computing and Communications.

This paper introduces a novel framework for QSP, delineating its theoretical foundations and potential to surpass classical signal processing capabilities. The research delves into the development of quantum algorithms that exhibit superior efficiency in the frequency domain analysis and the processing of temporally entangled signal structures. A pivotal aspect of this work is the introduction of quantum Fourier transforms as a mechanism to achieve exponential speed-ups in signal decomposition. Furthermore, the paper explores the implementation of quantum error correction techniques to enhance the robustness of signal processing in the presence of quantum noise and decoherence. The practicality of QSP is demonstrated through simulated quantum circuits, providing a blueprint for future quantum computing hardware applications. The implications of this research are profound, suggesting a transformative impact on fields ranging from secure communications to biomedical imaging. By harnessing the entanglement and superposition properties inherent to quantum systems, QSP is poised to redefine the limits of what is computationally feasible within information processing.  © 2023 IEEE.",Quantum Algorithms; Quantum Computing Hardware; Quantum Fourier Transform; Quantum Noise; Quantum Signal Processing,Blueprints; Error correction; Fourier transforms; Medical imaging; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Quantum entanglement; Quantum noise; Quantum optics; Computing hardware; Frequency-domain analysis; Quantum algorithms; Quantum Computing; Quantum computing hardware; Quantum fourier transforms; Quantum signal processing; Signal processing capability; Signal structures; Theoretical foundations; Frequency domain analysis,,,,"Jaidass N., Krishna Moorthi C., Mohan Babu A., Reddi Babu M., Luminescence properties of Dy3+ doped lithium zinc borosilicate glasses for photonic applications, Heliyon, 4, 3, (2018); Spandana K., Rao V.R.S., Internet of Things (Iot) Based smart water quality monitoring system, International Journal of Engineering and Technology (UAE), 7, 3, pp. 259-262, (2018); Usha Kumari C., Sampath Dakshina Murthy A., Lakshmi Prasanna B., Pala Prasad Reddy M., Kumar Panigrahy A., An automated detection of heart arrhythmias using machine learning technique: SVM, Materials Today: Proceedings, 45, pp. 1393-1398, (2021); Suresh Goud J., Srilatha P., Varun Kumar R.S., Thanesh Kumar K., Khan U., Raizah Z., Singh Gill H., Galal A.M., Role of ternary hybrid nanofluid in the thermal distribution of a dovetail fin with the internal generation of heat, Case Studies in Thermal Engineering, 35, (2022); Basavapoornima C., Kesavulu C.R., Maheswari T., Pecharapa W., Depuru S.R., Jayasankar C.K., Spectral characteristics of Pr3+-doped lead based phosphate glasses for optical display device applications, Journal of Luminescence, 228, (2020); Ramu G., A secure cloud framework to share EHRs using modified CP-ABE and the attribute bloom filter, Educ Inf Technol, 23, pp. 2213-2233, (2018); Nagarjuna T., Nehru K., Nagendra Prasad G., Menakadevi N., Smart sensor network based high quality air pollution monitoring system using labview, International Journal of Online Engineering, 13, 8, pp. 79-87, (2017); Indira D.N.V.S.L.S., Ganiya R.K., Ashok Babu P., Xavier A.J., Kavisankar L., Hemalatha S., Senthilkumar V., Kavitha T., Rajaram A., Annam K., Yeshitla A., Improved Artificial Neural Network with State Order Dataset Estimation for Brain Cancer Cell Diagnosis, Biomed Res Int., 2022, (2022); Radhakrishna V., Kumar P.V., Janaki V., Rajasekhar N., Estimating Prevalence Bounds of Temporal Association Patterns to Discover Temporally Similar Patterns, Recent Advances in Soft Computing.

In most cases dedicated laboratory equipment are used to generate, collect and store Quantum Keys for encryption purposes. Reliable and effective quantum key generation at long distances requires an entangled photon pair generator, which is a precise optical device requiring alignment and calibration. Calibration can be performed on the ground before a flight, as well as in-orbit, during a flight. In many cases, this process needs to be performed periodically - once a month or even once a week. An approach with calibration on the ground requires a more sophisticated mechanical design that prevents the decalibration. However, in many cases preventing the decalibration by the mechanical design might not be possible.

Due to the massive generation of delay-sensitive data, this system demands a robust security mechanism against security threats. In order to mitigate such potential attacks and provide security-free services, this article proposes an edge-based conditional privacy-preserving authentication scheme based on quantum key distribution protocol for secure authentication and secure communication within smart grid infrastructure. Apart from guaranteeing security against threats such as node impersonation, message tampering, and repudiation, the scheme also defends man-in-the-middle attacks, replay attacks, etc. We validate the proposed protocol through a simulation study. The result indicates that it performs reasonably well and enables unconditional security for the data exchanged between entities of smart grid infrastructure.  © 2013 IEEE.",Privacy-preserving authentication; security threats; smart grid,Authentication; Electronic data interchange; Network protocols; Network security; Privacy-preserving techniques; Quantum cryptography; Remote control; Security systems; Sensitive data; Smart meters; Authentication scheme; Data accessibility; Grid infrastructures; Performance; Privacy-preserving authentication; Security; Security threats; Smart grid; Smart metering; Smart power grids,,"Ministry of Education, India, MoE","This work was supported by the Ministry of Education, Government of India.","Faheem M., Et al., Smart grid communication and information technologies in the perspective of industry 4.0: Opportunities and challenges, Comput.

One of the popular types of keyless entry systems used in cars is the Remote Keyless Entry (RKE) system. With the advent of quantum computers, quantum computing-enabled cyber-attacks are an imminent threat. The security offered by current cryptographic techniques is inadequate to protect systems such as RKE from such future quantum attacks. In this paper, we propose a quantum-safe authentication protocol leveraging Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) that authenticates a legitimate key fob before unlocking the car. We present a formal security proof and an informal analysis to show that the protocol is secure against several attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first protocol that protects RKE systems from future quantum computing-enabled cyber-attacks, in addition to the existing replay and RollJam attacks. © 2023 IEEE.",Authentication protocol; quantum gates; Quantum Key Distribution (QKD); remote keyless entry systems; security,Authentication; Computer crime; Crime; Cybersecurity; Network security; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Authentication protocols; Cyber-attacks; Imminent threats; Quanta computers; Quantum Computing; Quantum gates; Quantum key distribution; Remote key-less entry systems; Security; Quantum cryptography,,"National Quantum-Safe Network, (NRF2021-QEP2-04-P01); National Research Foundation, Singapore and A*STAR","This research is supported by the National Research Foundation, Singapore and A*STAR under its Quantum Engineering Programme (National Quantum-Safe Network, NRF2021-QEP2-04-P01).","Joo K., Choi W., Lee D.H., Hold the door! fingerprinting your car key to prevent keyless entry car theft, 27th Annual Network and Distributed System Security Symposium, NDSS 2020, (2020); Alrabady A.I., Mahmud S.M., Analysis of attacks against the security of keyless-entry systems for vehicles and suggestions for improved designs, IEEE transactions on vehicular technology, 54, 1, pp. 41-50, (2005); Garcia F.D., Oswald D., Kasper T., Pavlides P., Lock it and still lose it-on the (in) security of automotive remote keyless entry systems, Proceedings of the 25th USENIX Security Symposium, pp. 929-944, (2016); Benadjila R., Renard M., Lopes-Esteves J., Kasmi C., One car, two frames: Attacks on hitag-2 remote keyless entry systems revisited, 11th {USENIX} Workshop on Offensive Technologies ({WOOT} 17), (2017); Defcon 23 rolljam attack; Greene K., Rodgers D., Dykhuizen H., McNeil K., Niyaz Q., Shamaileh K.A., Timestamp-based defense mechanism against replay attack in remote keyless entry systems, 2020 IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics (ICCE), pp. 1-4, (2020); Greene K., Rodgers D., Dykhuizen H., Niyaz Q., Al Shamaileh K., Devabhaktuni V., A defense mechanism against replay attack in remote keyless entry systems using timestamping and XOR logic, IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine, 10, 1, pp. 101-108, (2020); Glocker T., Mantere T., Elmusrati M., A protocol for a secure remote keyless entry system applicable in vehicles using symmetric-key cryptography, 2017 8th International Conference on Information and Communication Systems (ICICS).

In this scheme, each legal voter performs unitary operation on corresponding position of particle sequence to encode his/her voting content. The voters have multiple ballot items to choose rather than just binary options “yes” or “no”. After counting votes phase, any participant who is interested in voting results can obtain the voting results. To improve the efficiency of the traveling quantum anonymous voting scheme, an optimization method based on grouping strategy is also presented. Compared with the most existing traveling quantum voting schemes, the proposed scheme is more practical because of its privacy, verifiability and non-repeatability. Furthermore, the security analysis shows that the proposed traveling quantum anonymous voting scheme can prevent various attacks and ensure high security. © 2023 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.",GHZ states; privacy; quantum anonymous voting; quantum secure communication; verifiability,Quantum communication; Quantum theory; Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state; Grouping strategies; Optimization method; Privacy; Quantum anonymous voting; Quantum secure communication; Unitary operation; Verifiability; Voting results; Voting schemes; Quantum cryptography,,"Jiangsu Engineering Research Center of Novel Optical Fiber Technology and Communication Network and Suzhou Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Network Technology; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61873162); Soochow University","Project supported by the Tang Scholar Project of Soochow University, the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61873162), the Fund from Jiangsu Engineering Research Center of Novel Optical Fiber Technology and Communication Network and Suzhou Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Network Technology.","Xin T, Wang B X, Li K R, Kong X Y, Wei S J, Wang T, Ruan D, Long G L, Chin.

Since optical fibers have an exponential loss with distance, satellite-based QKD solutions are being developed in order to realize long-distance links. Therefore, Optical Ground Stations for QKD (QKD-OGS) need to be designed to enable quantum communication with satellites. Different link configurations will result in different integration options of the QKD-OGS in the terrestrial fiber network and therefore impact its performance. Applicable integration options must be identified and trade-off analysis conducted at the architecture, system and sub-system level. The reference scenario is a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) downlink configuration employing a decoy-state BB84 protocol with polarization encoded qubits at 1550 nm wavelength. The satellite acts as trusted node for implementation of the key distribution between two parties on ground. Furthermore, only direct connections from the satellite to the end-users are considered, i.e.The QKD-OGS does not serve as a trusted-node relay. This results in the selection of three main integration concepts: first, a free-space, end-user QKD-OGS which is located directly at the end-user where the quantum signal is measured directly behind the receiver telescope in free-space; second, a fiber-coupled, end-user QKD-OGS where the quantum signal is coupled into a single-mode fiber and guided to a co-located server room hosting the QKD Receiver system; third, a fiber-coupled, provider QKD-OGS, which reaches several end-users by using a local fiber network. In order to evaluate these three concepts, the comparison parameter is defined to be an estimated factor of suppliable end-users. The estimated comparison factor shows that the fiber-coupled, enduser QKD-OGS can supply 6.7 times more end users than the free-space, end-user QKD-OGS. The fiber-coupled, end-user QKD-OGS can supply 129.7 times more end-users than the free-space, end-user QKD-OGS.  © 2023 IEEE.",Optical Ground Station; Quantum Key Distribution; quantum network; secure communication,Communication satellites; Economic and social effects; Integration; Optical fiber communication; Orbits; Quantum communication; Satellite communication systems; Signal receivers; Single mode fibers; A.Fibres; End-users; Fiber coupled; Fiber networks; Free spaces; Future proofs; Information- theoretic securities; Optical ground station; Quantum network; Quantum signals; Quantum cryptography,,,,"Gisin N., Ribordy G., Tittel W., Zbinden H., Quantum cryptography, Rev.

A fresh paradigm emerges with the introduction of a novel public key cipher system termed Polar Code-based Public Key Cryptosystem (PC-PKC). Grounded in the intricate nature of encryption operations within polar code constructs, the PC-PKC system establishes a resilient security framework. To substantiate its efficacy, the PC-PKC cipher system is practically implemented on Raspberry Zero hardware. Through a comprehensive evaluation of performance metrics encompassing execution time, energy consumption, and CPU utilization, a detailed efficiency analysis is unveiled. This empirical exploration underscores the PC-PKC system's superiority over the existing McAleese public key code system deployed on Raspberry Pi Zero. The assessment demonstrates the PC-PKC cipher system's supremacy in critical facets, including encryption and decryption execution times, as well as energy consumption. These results accentuate the potency of polar codes as a cornerstone for post-quantum cryptographic solutions, positioning the PC-PKC system as a promising contender to ensure secure communication protocols in the quantum computing era.  © 2023 IEEE.",Polar Codes; Post-quantum Cryptosystems; Public Key Cryptography; Raspberry Pi Zero,Computation theory; Energy utilization; Number theory; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Code system; Energy-consumption; Polar codes; Post quantum; Post-quantum cryptosystem; Public key cryptosystems; Public keys; Quanta computers; Quantum cryptosystems; Raspberry pi zero; Public key cryptography,,,,"Rivest R.L., Shamir A., Adleman L., A method for obtaining digital signatures and public-key cryptosystems, Communications of the ACM magazine, 21, 2, pp. 120-126, (1978); ElGamal T., A public key cryptosystem and a signature scheme based on discrete logarithms, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 31, 4, pp. 469-472, (1985); Shor P.W., Algorithms for quantum computation: Discrete logarithms and factoring, Proc.

Considering the expanding dependence on information technology (IT) systems for a broad spectrum of military operations, the stakes have never been higher for thwarting successful cyberattacks. Conventional security protocols have become increasingly precarious in the face of evolving cyber threats. This necessitates the adoption of avant-garde and nascent technologies to bolster the military's cybersecurity stance. The paper delves into an array of incipient technologies that proffers the prospect of enhancing cybersecurity in the realm of defence. These include artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), blockchain, and quantum computing. AI can be leveraged to automate numerous cybersecurity functions, such as threat detection and response. ML can augment the precision of threat detection and response systems. Blockchain, a distributed ledger technology, can safeguard data and transactions. Quantum computing, a nascent technology, harbours the potential to revolutionize computation. It could be utilized to breach present-day encryption standards, thereby rendering data vulnerable to attackers.

By minimizing information leakage that can happen during the key generation process, privacy amplification is a technique used to improve the security of QKD. The technique involves processing the raw key obtained from QKD through a randomization procedure to remove any residual information that may have been leaked during the quantum transmission. While privacy amplification can significantly improve the security of QKD, the effectiveness of the technique is limited by the quality of the initial raw key. The BB84 QKD protocol has been improved with the proposed En-BB84 protocol, which includes built-in authentication and integrity checks. The En-BB84 protocol ensures secure distribution of secret keys and protects against tampering by attackers. Key distillation and error correction techniques are employed to extract a shorter, more secure shared secret key and correct errors introduced during qubit transmission. The protocol utilizes a four-state QKD approach, expanding on the traditional two-state scheme of BB84. A simulation of the En-BB84 protocol is demonstrated using a quantum circuit implemented with Qiskit in Python. The circuit employs various gates and operations, including Hadamard, CX, controlled swap, and RZ gates, to achieve encoding and error correction. Furthermore, we have designed a better protocol with improved error rates by incorporating improvisations on the BB84 protocol. Experimental results indicate the successful integration of the B92 error correction scheme into the modified BB84 protocol, enhancing the security and performance of QKD systems.  © 2023 IEEE.",B92 error correction; En-BB84 protocol; Quantum key distribution(QKD),Authentication; Computer software; Distillation; Quantum cryptography; Quantum theory; Transmissions; B92 error correction; BB84 protocol; En-bb84 protocol; Error resilience; Errors correction; Information leakage; Privacy amplification; Quantum physics; Secret key; Secure quantum key distributions; Error correction,,,,"Li Q., Ma S., Mao H., Meng L., An FPGA-Based Communication Scheme of Classical Channel in High-Speed QKD System, 2014 Tenth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing, pp. 227-230, (2014); Kamran M., Khan M.M., Malik T., Decoy state HD QKD system for secure optical communication, 2021 International Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security ICCWS, pp. 87-92, (2021); Liu G., Liu F., Research on Data Integrity of Information Management System Based on QKD Error-Correction, 2021 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Industrial Design (AIID, pp. 30-34, (2021); Lou D., Et al., Benchmark Performance of Digital QKD Platform Using Quantum Permutation Pad, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 107066-107076, (2022); Bacsardi L., Kis Z., Imre S., Second generation QKD system over commercial fibers, 2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO, pp. 488-492, (2016); Mamiya A., Et al., Satellite-based QKD for Global Quantum Cryptographic Network Construction, 2022 IEEE International Conference on Space Optical Systems and Applications (ICSOS, pp. 47-50, (2022); Gatto A., Et al., Integration of QKD Technologies in Advanced Optical Networks, 2022 IEEE 15th Workshop on Low Temperature Electronics (WOLTE, pp. 1-4, (2022); Klicnik O., Tomasov A., Munster P., Horvath T., Hajny J., Longterm Parameters Monitoring of the IDQ Clavis 3 QKD System, 2022 International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM, pp. 1-4, (2022); Ai X., Malaney R., Ng S.X., A Reconciliation Strategy for Real-Time Satellite-Based QKD, IEEE Communications Letters, 24, 5, pp. 1062-1066, (2020); Li Q., Lin D Le Z., Liu H., An FPGA-Based Design of Efficient QKD Sifting Module, 2014 Tenth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing, pp. 219-222, (2014); Huttner B., Et al., Quantum cryptography with coherent states, Physical Review A, 51, 3, pp. 1863-1869, (1995); Xu F., Et al., Secure quantum key distribution with realistic devices, Reviews of Modern Physics, 92, 2, (2020); Hwang W.-Y., Quantum Key Distribution with High Loss: Toward Global Secure Communication, Physical Review Letters, 91, 5, (2003); Fung C.-H.F., Et al., Phase-remapping attack in practical quantum-keydistribution systems, Physical Review A, 75, 3, (2007); Makarov V., Hjelme D.R., Faked states attack on quantum cryptosystems, Journal of Modern Optics, 52, 5, pp. 691-705, (2005); Makarov V., Et al., Effects of detector efficiency mismatch on security of quantum cryptosystems, Physical Review A, 74, 2, (2006); Jain N., Et al., Device Calibration Impacts Security of Quantum Key Distribution, Physical Review Letters, 107, 11, (2011); Qi B., Et al., Time-shift attack in practical quantum cryptosystems, Quantum Information and Computation, 7, 12, pp. 73-82, (2007); Wei K., Et al., Implementation security of quantum key distribution due to polarization-dependent efficiency mismatch, Physical Review A, 100, 2, (2019)","Y.

We propose two approaches to manage the signal for quantum key exchange between two trusted nodes; in the first approach, the quantum channel (QCh) uses distinct fiber whereas the classic channel (CCh) and public interaction channel (PICh) use another fiber to be transmitted on C-band (C+L band), and in the second approach CCh and PICh are transmitted over C+L band and QCh only uses O-band, both routed on the same fiber. In this context, two variations of the initial approach have been put forth, namely scenario 1 and scenario 2. In scenario 1, the CChs are positioned within the extended C-band, while in scenario 2, they find their place within the extended C+L-band. Concerning the secondary approach, denoted as scenario 3, the CChs+PIChs and QChs are situated in the extended C+L-band and low-loss O-band with consideration of noises over QChs, respectively. We propose a heuristic resource allocation with a time-division multiplexing technique in quan-tum resource allocation to compare the resource utilization of the mentioned approaches. The simulation outcomes demonstrate the advantages of adopting scenario 3 in relation to fiber deployment. This is highlighted by an 86 % (34 %) enhancement in fiber efficiency when compared to scenario 1 (2), all while employing an equal count of quantum transmitters and receivers over the initial eight years. As per the specifications of scenario 3, during the concluding year, there has been a notable 44 % surge in quantum transmitter and receiver utilization for both scenarios 1 and 2. This upsurge is accompanied by a substantial reduction in fiber utilization, amounting to a 117 % (34 %) reduction concerning scenario 1 (2).  © 2023 IEEE.",Elastic Optical Networks; multi-band; Quantum Key Distribution (QKD),Communication channels (information theory); Fiber optic networks; Fibers; Optical communication; Quantum communication; Quantum theory; Resource allocation; Transmitters; Channel interactions; Elastic optical networks; In-fiber; Interaction channel; Multi band; Public interactions; Quantum channel; Quantum key distribution; Resources allocation; Transmitter and receiver; Quantum cryptography,,"European Union s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA, (801538); H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA; European Commission, EC, (101092766); European Commission, EC; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, UC3M",Funding text 1: Farhad Arpanaei acknowledges support from the CONEX-Plus programme funded by Universidad Carlos III de Madrid and the European Union s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 801538.

However, current discrete-modulation protocols require relatively large constellation sizes to achieve a key rate comparable to that of the Gaussian modulation. Here, we show that a high key rate comparable to the Gaussian modulation can be achieved using only ten or so coherent states by implementing suitable key map and numerical convex optimization techniques. Specifically, the key rate of the two-ring constellation with 12 coherent states (four states in the inner ring and eight states in the outer ring) can reach 2.4 times of that of original quadrature phase shift keying and 70% of the Gaussian modulation protocol at 50 km. Such an approach can easily be applied to existing systems, making the discrete-modulation protocol an attractive alternative for high-rate and low-cost applications in secure quantum communication networks. © 2023 The Author(s).

J.H., Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences, Tamil Nadu, Coimbatore, 641114, India","Deciding the correct offensive security strategy for safeguarding the electrical physical infrastructures of smart grids is a challenging task. The offensive security training against various cyber-attacks focuses on a multitude of electrical subsystems and measurement systems like the Load Frequency Control(LFC) system. Primarily, the principal challenge is to categorize and parameterize the various possible cyber-attacks on electrical infrastructures. This is done by specifying and selecting cyber-attacks considering various main and subsystem blocks of the power structural system within each area of major installations. In this research investigation, formal modeling of security strategy is proposed using Lambda calculus with both classical and quantum perspectives. Furthermore, using a Quantum Machine Learning (QML) technique, the procedure for correct vulnerability prediction, exploitation, and execution strategy is presented with an approximated likelihood of attack and its mode. The local and non-local interactions are introduced as quantum threats and entanglement threats similar to False Data Injection (FDI) methods to induce the attack and counter-attack events through quantum causality connections. Finally, the Quirk simulator is used to validate the proposed quantum design of offensive and defensive attack models considering scenarios of exogenous and scaling attacks on the LFC systems that support the feasibility of the present research work to address the issue of cyber-attacks on the power system networks. © 2023",Cybersecurity; False data injection; Load frequency control; Local interactions and entanglements; Quantum computing; Quantum machine learning; Smart grid,Computer crime; Crime; Cyber attacks; Differentiation (calculus); Electric control equipment; Electric frequency control; Electric loads; Electric power system control; Network security; Press load control; Quantum entanglement; Smart power grids; Cyber security; False data injection; Load-frequency control; Local interaction and entanglement; Local interactions; Machine-learning; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Smart grid; Machine learning,,,,"Marco G.D., Loia V., Karimipour H., Siano P., Assessing insider attacks and privacy leakage in managed IoT systems for residential prosumers, Energies, 14, (2021); Abbaspour A., Sargolzaei A., Forouzannezhad P., Yen K.K., Sarwat A.I., Resilient control design for load frequency control system under false data injection attacks, IEEE Trans.

Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and Quantum key distribution (QKD) are two security technologies that show protection capabilities against the latent quantum threat. While PQC relies on different hard mathematical problems to develop a wide variety of cryptographic operations, QKD is based on quantum physics laws to generate and distribute symmetric cryptographic keys through different QKD protocols. These keys can be used by different applications to perform security transformations. QKD still requires authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. The hybridization of PQC and QKD is an important step for future secure infrastructures, being able to provide long-term security. In this work we propose authenticated QKD approaches that rely on pre-shared keys and hybrid PQC/QKD alternatives and which are able to securely exchange secret QKD keys through authenticated channels. We identify the different configuration alternatives and their parameters, as well as we develop a wide performance evaluation. Results show that pre-shared keys and PQC-based authentication through Dilithium algorithm are the fastest alternatives. Also, we show the potential of the T12 QKD protocol.  © 2023 IEEE.",BB84; Post Quantum; PQC; QKD; Quantum secure communication,Authentication; Network security; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Quantum communication; Quantum computers; Secure communication; 'current; Bb84; Cryptographic algorithms; Hybridisation; Post quantum; Post quantum cryptography; Quanta computers; Quantum secure communication; Quantum-key- distribution protocol; Security technology; Quantum cryptography,,,,"Shor P., Algorithms for quantum computation: Discrete logarithms and factoring, Proceedings 35th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science.

The research of quantum secure communication started earlier, and the technology gradually matured. At present, it is rapidly developing into networked applications, and has entered the practical and large-scale networking stage. In order to improve the resource utilization rate of the network, an optimal allocation model of quantum communication resources based on grey clustering algorithm is proposed. The author uses the grey dynamic clustering algorithm based on interval grey number to divide users into a group of clusters, and selects a node in each cluster as the cluster head, as the gateway and the relay node within the cluster, and the cluster head as the gateway within the cluster to manage the mobility of local users. It can cluster users, reduce the number of quantum communication links used when forwarding signaling messages, reduce the cost of using resources and improve network throughput.

However, existing protocols can be limited by speed, and considerations around their practical implementation. We report on a novel quantum communications protocol, called the spread photon transceiver, which operates on the physical layer of a communications link with a pair of matched receivers, to achieve quantum security. The sensitivity of the matched receiver architecture to experimental error is evaluated. A security analysis of the protocol is conducted, evaluating the private information rate achievable between the intended sender and receiver, assuming a quantum-powerful adversary, with receiver losses reflective of scenarios which may be encountered in a military field environment.  © 2023 IEEE.",physical layer security; Quantum communications; quantum data locking; spread photon transceiver,Quantum communication; Quantum cryptography; Transceivers; Data locking; Information exchanges; Physical layer security; Private information; Protocol cans; Quantum communication protocols; Quantum data; Quantum data locking; Quantum resources; Spread photon transceiver; Photons,,,,"Scarani V., Bechmann-Pasquinucci H., Cerf N.J., Dusek M., Lutkenhaus N., Peev M., The security of practical quantum key distribution, Rev.

However, the interconnectivity and open nature of such systems in smart industrial facilities can also be targeted and abused by malicious actors, which reinforces the importance of cyber security. In this paper, we present a secure, decentralized, and Differentially Private (DP) Federated Learning (FL)-based IDS (2DF-IDS), for securing smart industrial facilities. The proposed 2DF-IDS comprises three building blocks, namely: a key exchange protocol (for securing the communicated weights among all peers in the system), a differentially private gradient exchange scheme (achieve improved privacy of the FL approach), and a decentralized FL approach (that mitigates the single point of failure/attack risk associated with the aggregation server in the conventional FL approach). We evaluate our proposed system through detailed experiments using a real-world IoT/IIoT dataset, and the results show that the proposed 2DF-IDS system can identify different types of cyber attacks in an Industrial IoT system with high performance. For instance, the proposed system achieves comparable performance (94.37%) with the centralized learning approach (94.37%) and outperforms the FL-based approach (93.91%) in terms of accuracy. The proposed system is also shown to improve the overall performance by 12%, 13%, and 9% in terms of F1-score, recall, and precision, respectively, under strict privacy settings when compared to other competing FL-based IDS solutions. © 2023",Cybersecurity; Decentralized federated learning; Differential privacy; Industry 4.0; Intrusion detection; IoT/IIoT security; Post-Quantum cryptography; Privacy,Computer crime; Cyber Physical System; Cybersecurity; Industry 4.0; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Network security; Quantum cryptography; Cyber security; Decentralised; Decentralized federated learning; Differential privacies; Internet of thing/IIoT security; Intrusion-Detection; Learning approach; Performance; Post quantum cryptography; Privacy; Internet of things,,,,"Abadi M., Chu A., Goodfellow I., McMahan H.B., Mironov I., Talwar K., Zhang L., Deep learning with differential privacy, Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 308-318, (2016); Aono Y., Hayashi T., Wang L., Moriai S., Et al., Privacy-preserving deep learning via additively homomorphic encryption, IEEE Trans.

By leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics, QKD allows two parties to establish a secret key securely, which can subsequently be used for encrypting and decrypting sensitive information. While QKD holds immense promise for enhancing cybersecurity, it also presents several challenges that necessitate further research to achieve its full potential. The research presented here examines the development of QKD networks, their real-world use, as well as the general QKD network architecture and the most recent advancements in QKD network deployments.  © 2023 IEEE.",Quantum Key Distribution (QKD Networks,Network architecture; Quantum theory; Cyber security; Digital age; Network deployment; Quantum key distribution (quantum key distribution network; Real-world; Revolutionary technology; Secret key; Sensitive informations; Quantum cryptography,,,,"Toshiba QKD System; Stanley J.M., Gui Y., Unnikrishnan D., Hall S.R.G., Fatadin I., Recent Progress in Quantum Key Distribution Network Deployments and Standards, 2022 J.

The essential function of transmitting and sharing a secret key between two entities is the safe key management technique, which is the most important components to be concerned about when incorporating cryptographic activities into any system. If the key management procedures are ineffective, the system will be vulnerable to vulnerabilities and potentially lethal outsider attacks. Quantum cryptography is a method of securely encrypting information sent between parties while also detecting intruders attempting to listen in on the discussion. Quantum cryptography holds promise as a solution to these and other issues. In this paper,we discuss the Quantum key distribution (BB84 protocol) and how when integrated with conventional cryptography algorithms it increases security in data transmission to a remarkably high level. We also compare the cryptography algorithms for different file sizes and measure their performance by calculating the Encryption,decryption,throughput and Avalanche effect of the algorithms with and without QKD. The elapsed time of the conventional algorithm with QKD achieve 56.8%, 58.6% and 54.3% less time than AES, 3DES and Blowfish respectively. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Classical cryptography;

To prepare for cybersecurity in the quantum era, some projects have been launched to call for post-quantum alternatives. Due to solid security and desirable performance, lattice-based cryptosystems are viewed as promising candidates in the upcoming standardisation of post-quantum cryptography. This study surveys the lattice-based cryptosystems in the post-quantum standardisation processes including the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardisation and the Chinese Cryptographic Algorithm Design Competition, from both design and security aspects. We present generic design paradigms of lattice-based schemes and describe several representative proposals and recent progress. We also recap some main cryptanalytic results and methods for estimating the concrete security of lattice-based schemes. © 2022 The Authors.

To overcome large distances, it requires the use of quantum repeaters, which are still challenging nevertheless feasible, or Twin-Field-QKD (TF-QKD) technology, which has been demonstrated several years ago. As it develops and matures, quantum technology is expected to play an increasingly major role in networks. Satellite QKD enables secure communication between devices via both satellites and ground stations. The study explores the transmission of quantum encryption technology in space and presents an overview of cubesats and satellites that currently use quantum key distribution (QKD) technology.  © 2023 IEEE.",free space; quantum cryptography; quantum key distribution; satellite,Communication satellites; Quantum communication; Quantum theory; Satellite communication systems; Communication techniques; Encryption technologies; Free spaces; Ground stations; In networks; Quantum encryption; Quantum repeaters; Quantum technologies; Satellite communications; Satellite stations; Quantum cryptography,,"Ministry of Science, Higher Education and Youth of Canton Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina; NATO Science for Peace and Security Programme, (G5894); Ministerstvo Vnitra České Republiky, (ID VJ01010008)","This research was supported by the Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic under the NeSPoQ project, Grant ID VJ01010008, and by the NATO Science for Peace and Security Programme under the QUANTUM5 project, Grant ID G5894.

It employs advanced computation techniques rather than conventional ones. To circumvent the limitations of conventional computing, new supercomputers employ quantum mechanics knowledge, which allows for the coherence of ones and zeros. Several fields like finance, healthcare, cybersecurity, transportation, climate change, and many more are taking advantage of QC. Indoor environmental quality (IEQ) is also one of the sectors that can benefit enormously with QC. The IEQ contains several parameters. Major IEQ parameters are indoor air quality, thermal comfort, acoustic comfort, and visual comfort. These parameters are associated with several physical, chemical, and biological components, which need critical computational considerations for accurate results and better understanding as the data can be highly overlapped.

The motivation is to explore the potential of Quantum Computing assisted cybersecurity for Security-by-Design (SbD) of Industrial-Internet-of-Things (IIoT). Internet-of-Things (IoT) in Industry 4.0 can improve efficiency, increase automation, and facilitate intelligent decision making through the integration of edge cloud computing paradigms. However, the lack of standardization of security protocols across IIoT devices can be challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of these devices. In this context, a novel Quantum circuits based PUF design that is built on real Quantum hardware is presented. The proposed QPUF can facilitate security in IIoT by using a Quantum hardware generated PUF key as the device identity. The proposed PUF Design is built using Quantum Hadamard Gate, and Ry gates and has been experimentally demonstrated on IBM Quantum hardware systems. The proposed architecture also supports PUF key generation from Quantum hardware for security applications. Figures-of-merits (FoM) of PUF have been evaluated and presented to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed Quantum PUF for SbD of IIoT. © 2023 IEEE.",Hardware Assisted Security (HAS); Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT); Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF); Quantum Computing; Security-by-Design (SbD),Access control; Decision making; Hardware security; Network security; Noise abatement; Quantum cryptography; Cyber security; Function designs; Hardware assisted security; Hardware-assisted; Industrial internet-of-thing; Key generation; Physical unclonable function; Quantum Computing; Quantum system; Security-by-design; Internet of things,,,,"Ram S.K., Das B.B., Mahapatra K., Mohanty S.P., Choppali U., Energy Perspectives in IoT Driven Smart Villages and Smart Cities, IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine, 10, 3, pp. 19-28, (2021); Sisinni E., Saifullah A., Han S., Jennehag U., Gidlund M., Industrial Internet of Things: Challenges, Opportunities, and Directions, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 14, 11, pp. 4724-4734, (2018); Vakaloudis A., O'Leary C., A framework for rapid integration of IoT Systems with industrial environments, Proc.

It allows two entities to create a secure and unique session key for every communication session. We feel a need to design two party efficient and secure authenticated key agreement. We have also observed all the protocols given above are based on learning with error assumption over a finite ring. The”Module Learning with Errors” assumption is the more appropriate choice among”Learning with Errors” and”Ring Learning with Errors” for designing practical password-authenticated key exchange protocols. With the help of”Module Learning with Errors” assumption, and by lowering the number of ring polynomials, several implementations of the protocols can be realized. Therefore, this paper contains quantum safe, efficient, and practical”Module Learning with Errors” assumption based authenticated key agreement protocol.

We report our latest results on a range of AlGaInN diode-lasers targeted to meet the linewidth, wavelength and power requirements suitable for quantum sensors such as optical clocks and cold-atom interferometry systems. This includes the [5s2S1/2-5p2P1/2] cooling transition in strontium+ ion optical clocks at 422 nm, the [5s21S0-5p1P1] cooling transition in neutral strontium clocks at 461 nm and the [5s2s1/2 - 6p2P3/2] transition in rubidium at 420 nm. Several approaches are taken to achieve the required linewidth, wavelength and power, including an extended cavity laser diode (ECLD) system and an on-chip grating, distributed feedback (DFB) GaN laser diode. © 2023 SPIE.",GaN laser; GaN systems; Optical Atomic Clocks; Quantum Sensing,Aluminum compounds; Atom lasers; Atomic clocks; Diodes; III-V semiconductors; Indium compounds; Interferometry; Laser cooling; Optical communication; Quantum cryptography; Semiconductor lasers; Strontium; Timing circuits; Cooling transitions; GaN laser; GaN laser diodes; GaN system; Optical atomic clocks; Optical clocks; Quantum sensing; Quantum technologies; Sensing systems; Timing systems; Gallium nitride,,"UK innovation agency; European Commission, EC, (E113612); European Commission, EC; Narodowe Centrum Badań i Rozwoju, NCBR, (Eurostars/12/QGaN/E113612/2/2019); Narodowe Centrum Badań i Rozwoju, NCBR; Innovate UK","This research has been supported by the European Union with grant E113612, the UK innovation agency, Innovate UK and NCBR Poland (Eurostars/12/QGaN/E113612/2/2019).","Najda S.

It argues that the world in 2049 is unlikely to look like the climate change/artificial intelligence (AI) dystopia depicted in Blade Runner 2049, but nor will it be a world where conflict and war has been transformed by a civilising process that eradicates violence and conflict from the human condition. 2049 is also the year that the US Department of Defense has suggested China will become a world-shaping military power. All states will be engaged in 'arms races' across a variety of new tools and technologies from drones, robotics, AI and quantum computing that will transform politics, economy, society and war. Drawing on thinkers such as Zygmunt Bauman and Paul Virilio, the book suggests that future war will be shaped by three broad tendencies that include a broad range of tactics, technologies and trends; the impure, the granular and the machinic. Through discussions of cybersecurity, urban war, robotics, AI, climate change, science fiction and new strategic concepts, it examines how these tendencies might evolve in the different geopolitical futures and types of war ahead of us. The book provides a thought-provoking and distinctive framework through which to think about the changing character of war. It concludes that for all the novel and dangerous challenges ahead, the futuristic possibilities of warfare will likely continue to be shaped by problems familiar to students of international relations and the history of war albeit problems that will play out in geopolitical and technological contexts that we have never encountered before. This book will be of much interest to students of critical war studies, security studies, science and technology studies, and International Relations in general. © 2024 Mark Lacy.",,,,,,"Adams D., Comment: The Last Word, The Independent, 28 November, (1999);

Because the banking sector is an attractive target for cyberattacks, strong security measures are required. IoT technology provides data-driven security improvements, and automated responses, alongside real-time surveillance through its network of connected devices and sensors. This covers the following: property monitoring, innovations in blockchain technology, biometric identification, intelligent monitoring infrastructure, along fraud detection. The technical analysis explores the benefits and drawbacks of IoT-based security for banks. Data security, connectivity, adaptability, upkeep, and financial considerations are among the challenges. On the contrary, benefits like improved cybersecurity, cost-effectiveness, client trust, flexibility, and data analysis are provided by IoT-based security. The paper looks ahead, discussing the manner in which AI, blockchain technology, biometrics, cloud-based security, as well as quantum computing, will all be integrated into IoT-based security in the years to come. The financial sector is expected to implement a significant increase in IoT-based security measures.  © 2023 IEEE.",Banking Security; Cybersecurity; Financial Services; IoT Integration; Operational Efficiency,Biometrics; Blockchain; Cost effectiveness; Cybersecurity; Efficiency; Internet of things; Network security; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Banking industry; Banking operations; Banking security; Block-chain; Cyber security; Financial service; Internet of thing integration; Internet of things technologies; Operational efficiencies; Security measure; Integration,,,,"Alsharari N., Integrating blockchain technology with internet of things to efficiency, International Journal of Technology, Innovation and Management (IJTIM), 1, 2, pp. 1-13, (2021); Li F., Lu H., Hou M., Cui K., Darbandi M., Customer satisfaction with bank services: The role of cloud services, security, elearning and service quality, Technology in Society, 64, (2021); Singh S., Hosen A.S., Yoon B., Blockchain security attacks, challenges, and solutions for the future distributed iot network, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 13938-13959, (2021); Saxena S., Bhushan B., Ahad M.A., Blockchain based solutions to secure IoT: Background, integration trends and a way forward, Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 181, (2021); Garg P., Gupta B., Chauhan A.K., Sivarajah U., Gupta S., Modgil S., Measuring the perceived benefits of implementing blockchain technology in the banking sector, Technological forecasting and social change, 163, (2021); Rane S.B., Narvel Y.A.M., Re-designing the business organization using disruptive innovations based on blockchain-IoT integrated architecture for improving agility in future Industry 4.0, Benchmarking: An International Journal, 28, 5, pp. 1883-1908, (2021); Viriyasitavat W., Da Xu L., Bi Z., Pungpapong V., Blockchain and internet of things for modern business process in digital economy-The state of the art, IEEE transactions on computational social systems, 6, 6, pp. 1420-1432, (2019); Wu H., Han H., Wang X., Sun S., Research on artificial intelligence enhancing internet of things security: A survey, Ieee Access, 8, pp. 153826-153848, (2020); Tawalbeh L.A., Muheidat F., Tawalbeh M., Quwaider M., IoT Privacy and security: Challenges and solutions, Applied Sciences, 10, 12, (2020); Ravikumar S., Kavitha D., IoT based home monitoring system with secure data storage by Keccak-Chaotic sequence in cloud server, Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing, 12, pp. 7475-7487, (2021); Rijanto A., Blockchain technology adoption in supply chain finance, Journal of Theoretical and Applied Electronic Commerce Research, 7, pp. 3078-3098, (2021); Velmurugadass P., Dhanasekaran S., Anand S.S., Vasudevan V., Enhancing blockchain security in cloud computing with iot environment using ecies and cryptography hash algorithm, Materials Today: Proceedings, 37, pp. 2653-2659, (2021); Nguyen D.C., Pathirana P.N., Ding M., Seneviratne A., Integration of blockchain and cloud of things: Architecture, applications and challenges, IEEE Communications surveys & tutorials, 22, 4, pp. 2521-2549, (2020); Majeed U., Khan L.U., Yaqoob I., Kazmi S.A., Salah K., Hong C.S., Blockchain for iot-based smart cities: Recent advances, requirements, and future challenges, Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 181, (2021); Thusi P., Maduku D.K., South african millennials' acceptance and use of retail mobile banking apps: An integrated perspective, Computers in Human Behavior, 111, (2020); Kumari S., Kumar V., Sharmila A., Murthy C.R., Ahlawat N., Manoharan G., Blockchain-based e-analysis of social media forums for crypto currency phase shifts, 2023 5th International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications (ICIRCA), pp. 1222-1225, (2023); Shameem A., Ramachandran K.K., Sharma A., Singh R., Selvaraj F.J., Manoharan G., The rising importance of ai in boosting the efficiency of online advertising in developing countries, 2023 3rd International Conference on Advance Computing and Innovative Technologies in Engineering (ICACITE), pp. 1762-1766, (2023); Abdulwahid A.H., Pattnaik M., Palav M.R., Babu S.B.G.T., Manoharan G., Selvi G.P., Library management system using artificial intelligence, 2023 Eighth International Conference on Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (ICONSTEM), pp. 1-7, (2023)",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"10th IEEE Uttar Pradesh Section International Conference on Electrical, Electronics and Computer Engineering, UPCON 2023",1 December 2023 through 3 December 2023,Gautam Buddha Nagar,197661.0,,979-835038247-1,,,English,"IEEE Uttar Pradesh Sect.

For some multiuser quantum applications, access to a shared multipartite state is required. We consider the problem of designing protocols for distributing such states, at an increased rate. For this, we propose three protocols that leverage multipath routing to increase the distribution rate for multiuser applications. The protocols are evaluated on quantum networks with noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) constraints, including limited quantum memories and probabilistic entanglement generation. Simulation results show that the developed protocols achieve an exponential increase in the distribution rate of multipartite states compared to single-path routing techniques, with a maximum increase of four orders of magnitude for the cases studied. Furthermore, the relative increase in the distribution rate was also found to improve for larger sets of users. When the protocols were tested in scaled-down real-world topologies, it was found that a topology had a significant effect on the multipartite state distribution rates achieved by the protocols. Finally, we found that the benefits of multipath routing are maximum for short quantum memory decoherence times and intermediate values of entanglement generation probability. Hence, the protocols developed can benefit NISQ quantum network control and design.  © 2020 IEEE.","Distributed quantum computation; GreenbergerâÂ€Â""HorneâÂ€Â""Zeilinger (GHZ) states; multipartite; quantum communication; quantum internet","Distributed computer systems; Internet protocols; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Quantum entanglement; Topology; Distributed quantum computation; Entanglement distribution; Greenbergeraa€Â""horneaa€Â""zeilinger  state; Multi-paths routing; Multipartite; Multipartite state; Multiusers; Quantum internet; Quantum memory; Quantum network; Quantum communication",,,,"Wehner S., Elkouss D., Hanson R., Quantum internet: A vision for the road ahead, Science, 362, 6412, (2018); Cuomo D., Caleffi M., Cacciapuoti A.S., Towards a distributed quantum computing ecosystem, IET Quantum Commun, 1, 1, pp. 3-8; Bennett C.H., Brassard G., Popescu S., Schumacher B., Smolin J.A., Wootters W.K., Purification of noisy entanglement and faithful teleportation via noisy channels, Phys.

In our study, we performed a simulation based on two scenarios for quantum key distribution (QKD) with the absence and presence of attack between server and IoT device. Security of communication for IoT device is achieved by detecting the attacks on QKD process with a machine learning (ML) algorithm. Unlike traditional cyber security methods, the ML algorithm helped to detect attacks with 100% probability without interrupting the flow of information between the server and the IoT device.

ADS-B is a critical technology for air traffic control, providing real-time position and velocity information to air traffic controllers. However, the security of ADS-B communication is a major concern, as it is vulnerable to various security threats, including eavesdropping, data manipulation and injection attacks that could lead to accidents and loss of life. To ensure safe and efficient air travel, A reliable and secure communication system for ADS-B is essential. In this study, we will provide a comprehensive literature review of ADS-B communication and existing encryption methods. We will evaluate the performance of the proposed BB84-Quantum algorithm through simulations and assess its effectiveness in securing ADS-B communication. Our research aims to provide insight into the potential application of the proposed algorithm in the aviation industry. The proposed algorithm's originality lies in its use of quantum mechanics principles to provide secure communication between aircraft and ground stations, ensuring a safe connection for sending and receiving messages in ADS-B packets. © 2023 IEEE.",ADS-B; Aviation; BB84-quantum algorithm; Communication security; Encryption; Quantum Key Distribution,Air; Air navigation; Air traffic control; Air transportation; Aircraft; Aircraft communication; Deceleration; Digital communication systems; Network security; Quantum cryptography; Quantum theory; Secure communication; Security systems; Automatic dependent surveillance broadcasts; Aviation industry; Bb84-quantum algorithm; Broadcast communication; Broadcast data; Communications security; Data-transmission; Quantum algorithms; Symmetric keys; Transmission security; Aircraft accidents,,,,"Hajj A., Kobeissi J., Analysis of vulnerabilities, attacks, countermeasures, and overall risk of the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) system, Journal of Information Security and Applications, 35, pp. 58-76, (2017); Lim C., Emerging threats from cyber security in aviation: Challenges and mitigations, Journal of Aviation Management, 1, 1, pp. 14-29, (2014); Bennett C.H., Brassard G., Quantum cryptography: Public key distribution and coin tossing, Proc.

All our programs are designed to be hands-on and expose students to a wide skill set. All our majors need to take several security-related courses. One of the latest security related courses we developed is in Quantum Computing with a focus on security. Quantum Computing is a groundbreaking technology that exploits the laws and properties of quantum mechanics. It can dramatically speed up computations of certain problems and surpass the computation power of modern supercomputers. One notable quantum algorithm we cover in our newly developed course is Grover's algorithm. It is used to search an unstructured database while providing quadratic speedup, compared to its classical counterpart. While demonstrating Grover's algorithm in the classroom, the students raise many questions and explaining all the details of the algorithm is challenging.

Classical security methods for protecting such networks will not be effective enough if quantum computers become widespread. On the other hand, we can exploit the capabilities of quantum computing and communications to build a new quantum communication network. In this paper, we focused on enhancing the performance of the classical client–server Internet application. For this sake, we introduced a novel Internet of Things (IoT) quantum network that provides high security and Quality of Service (QoS) compared with the traditional IoT network. This can be achieved by adding quantum components to the traditional IoT network. Quantum counterpart nodes, channels, and servers are used. In order to establish a secure communication between the quantum nodes and the quantum server, we defined a new Communication Procedure (CP) for the suggested IoT quantum network. The currently available quantum computer has a small qubit size (from 50 to 433 qubits). The proposed IoT quantum network allows us to overcome this problem by concatenating the computation efforts of multiple quantum nodes (quantum processors). © 2023 by the authors.",internet of things; quantum information; quantum internet; quantum networks,,,"Ministry of Culture and Innovation; Quantum Information National Laboratory of Hungary, (2022-2.1.1-NL-2022-00004); Magyar Tudományos Akadémia, MTA, (BO/00118/20); Magyar Tudományos Akadémia, MTA; Nemzeti Kutatási Fejlesztési és Innovációs Hivatal, NKFIH","The research was supported by the Ministry of Culture and Innovation and the National Research, Development and Innovation Office within the Quantum Information National Laboratory of Hungary (Grant No. 2022-2.1.1-NL-2022-00004).

However, physical obstacles such as oceans and mountains may block optical fiber channels, and thus quantum networks (QNs) may have multiple disjoint domains. To overcome the issue, in this paper, we first propose a promising framework termed SSR to leverage satellite-based Free-Space Optical (FSO) channels to create inter-domain entangled paths for long-distance requests. Still, FSO channels may be intermittent due to satellite sparsity and atmospheric turbulence. Then, we introduce two algorithms, named RAIN and IDOL, to efficiently utilize FSO channels in SSR. RAIN estimates the existence probability of FSO channels to plan an appropriate inter-domain routing for each request while balancing domain loads. IDOL selects desired intra-domain paths and trusted repeaters for each request to teleport data qubits. Finally, simulation results manifest that SSR runs efficiently and outperforms existing approaches by 31%-57% in throughput.  © 2023 IEEE.",,Optical fibers; Quantum cryptography; Quantum entanglement; Rain; Satellites; Existence probabilities; Free-space optical; Inter-domain; Interdomain Routing; Multi-domains; Optical channels; Optical fiber channels; Quantum network; Quantum teleportation; Routings; Atmospheric turbulence,,,,"Elliott C., Building the quantum network, New J.

Our method can detect any attempts to deceive it by exploiting a non-classical correlation of photon pairs while rejecting strong chaotic light illumination through photon heralding. A security analysis based on polarization-correlation has been conducted, demonstrating that our method has improved security compared to existing quantum-secured imaging. More specifically, a partial deceiving attack, which sends a mixture of a true and a false signal, can be detected with our proposed analysis, while currently employed methods cannot. We also provide proof-of-principle demonstrations of our method and trustworthy images reconstructed using our security analysis. Our method can be developed using matured techniques used in quantum secure communication, thus offering a promising direc-; tion for practical applications in secure imaging. © 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement.",,Pixels; Quantum cryptography; Security systems; Chaotic light; Classical correlation; Imaging method; Light illumination; Photon pairs; Polarization correlation; Proof of principles; Secure imaging; Security analysis; Single pixel; Photons,,"Defense Acquisition Program Administration, DAPA; Agency for Defense Development, ADD",Acknowledgment.

But to learn/understand quantum computing, one should have strong knowledge of its basics. Because quantum computing performs operations at the atomic level, so the learners need to understand basic concepts like Qubits, Superposition, Quantum gates, etc. Therefore this chapter gives a clear idea about the basic concepts of quantum computing like Qubits, Superposition, Entanglement, Teleportation, and Quantum gates. © 2023, IGI Global.

Distributed blockchain technology in e-voting can only provide verification advantages. However, voters’ authenticity, data confidentiality, and intermediaries represent other major concerns in this regard. Existing secure voting frameworks either provide final voting results with the help of trusted intermediaries or provide vote verifiability in an unencrypted domain. At present, there is no such realistic mechanism to assure full security of vote casting and result declaration from cyber threats. Even Microsoft’s ElectionGuard is not free from post-quantum attacks due to additive ElGamal cryptosystem. To achieve effective guards against cyberattacks, we propose a voting framework, which reduces vote transmission overhead on a per-voter basis and supports post-quantum secure automated vote counting and winner selection without any manual intervention with the aid of multi-key homomorphic encryption. Along with suitable preventive measures against double voting, vote rigging, and coercion effects, we include a secure result deciphering process evading the possibility of result alteration using multi-key approach. Though our scheme is scalable for smaller as well as large organizations/communities, encrypted processing is inherently performance-costly. Hence, to reduce the overall timing overhead, encrypted hierarchical processing with zonal segregation and parallel computation have been incorporated. Our proposed scheme demonstrates party-specific vote counting without rank generation within 4 days and 22 h and vote counting with winner rank calculation within 5 days (for four candidates and one hundred thousand voters) without any manual intervention with the support of suitable distributed computing. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",E-voting; Homomorphic Encryption; Multi-key; Privacy; Security,Cybersecurity; Electronic voting; Quantum cryptography; Digitisation; E-Voting; End-to-end security; Ho-momorphic encryptions; Homomorphic-encryptions; Manual intervention; Multi-key; Post quantum; Privacy; Security; Cost reduction,,,,"Anane R., Freeland R., Theodoropoulos G., E-voting requirements and implementation, The 9Th IEEE International Conference on E-Commerce Technology and the 4Th IEEE International Conference on Enterprise Computing, E-Commerce and E-Services (CEC-EEE 2007), Pp. 382–392.

Post-quantum cryptography ensures that the information exchange between IoT devices can resist potential quantum computer attacks, thereby enhancing the quantum security of the IoT. This paper presents a quantum-secure hardware-software architecture for embedded systems. An FPGA-based post-quantum cryptographic Kyber accelerator and an STM32 microcontroller with AES encryption are integrated into the system. Customized hardware structures such as hash and modular arithmetic unit provide faster calculation speed. The command exchange protocol bridges embedded software and FPGA hardware. The server handles key generation and decryption, while the client manages encryption. AES-256 encryption is utilized to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data and keys, with the Kyber algorithm encrypting the session keys. Compared to previous works, this implementation demonstrates better resource utilization as well as enhanced performance in key generation, encryption, and decryption. Hardware implementation operates at 100MHz on the Artix-7 FPGA platform, consuming 20,782 LUTs, 5,077 FFs, 7.5 BRAMs, and 8 DSPs. The architecture also achieves up to 1.5× speed improvements in encryption and similar enhancements in decryption across various security levels. © 2023 IEEE.",AES; Hardware-software architecture; Kyber; Post-quantum cryptography; Secure communication,Computer hardware; Embedded systems; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Hardware security; Quantum cryptography; Software architecture; AES; Embedded-system; Hardware-software architecture; Hardware/software; Information exchanges; Key generation; Kyber; Post quantum cryptography; Quanta computers; Third parties; Internet of things,,"Laboratory Open Fund of Beijing Smart-chip Microelectronics Technology Co.

Diffie-Hellman (DH) is de-facto standard but not post-quantum secure. In this paper, we shall invent and analyze a new security primitive that is specifically designed for WPAN. For WPAN, wireless channel-based secret key generation has been proposed but was not widely deployed due to its critical dependence on the channel's entropy which is uncontrollable. We formulate a different approach: We still exploit channel properties but mainly hinge on the reciprocity of the wireless channel and not on the channel's entropy. The radio advantage comes from the use of full duplex communication. We show that in this situation both legitimate parties can agree on a common secret key even without ever probing the channel. At the core is a new bisparse blind deconvolution scheme for which we prove correctness and information-theoretic, i.e. perfect, security. We show that, ultimately, a secret key can be extracted and give a lower bound for the number of secret key bits which is then verified by experiments. We also notice a remote correspondence of the scheme to DH key exchange.  © 2023 IEEE.",bisparse blind deconvolution; compressive security; DH key exchange; full duplex; Physical layer security; wireless channel based secret key generation (SKG),Entropy; Information theory; Network layers; Quantum cryptography; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Bisparse blind deconvolution; Blind deconvolution; Compressive security; Diffie-Hellman key exchange; Full-duplex; Physical layer security; Secret key; Secret key generations; Wireless channel; Wireless channel based secret key generation; Convolution,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (598/7-1, 598/7-2, 598/8-1, 598/8-2); Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF; Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse","0AF was supported by the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP) funded by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation.

Primary authentication is a key procedure for initiating secure communication between User Equipment (UE) and Home Network (HN) in 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). However, primary authentication mechanisms used in 5G are vulnerable against quantum machines, replay attacks, and rouge base-station. To protect against these threats, we propose beyond 5G and 6G primary authentication methods to adapt hybrid mechanisms which combines Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and existing asymmetric algorithm with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) guarantee. We evaluate proposed methods using our in-house developed Simulator 'WirelessPQCSim.' Our proposed Hybrid mechanisms provide enhanced security without additional CPU overhead with respect to exiting 5G system. We also achieved up to 6.7x speed-up for PQC-based methods with respect to 5G system and provide low latency which is one of the KPI for 6G system. © 2023 IEEE.",,5G mobile communication systems; Authentication; Mobile security; Personal communication systems; Quantum cryptography; 3rd generation; Data latencies; Data-rate; Forward secrecy; Hybrid mechanisms; Hybrid method; Performance requirements; Post quantum; Post quantum cryptography; User equipments; Network security,,,,"Shor P.W., Algorithms for quantum computation: Discrete logarithms and factoring, Proceedings 35th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, pp. 124-134, (1994); Quentin Ulitzsch V., Park S., Marzougui S., Seifert J., A Post-Quantum Secure Subscription Concealed Identifier for 6G, Proceedings of the 15th ACM Conference on Security and Privacy in Wireless and Mobile Networks (WiSec '22), pp. 157-168, (2022); Damir M.T., Meskanen T., Ramezanian S., Niemi V., A Beyond-5G Authentication and Key Agreement Protocol, Network and System Security.

The article discusses the use of the concept of Network Slicing in combination with quantum key distribution protocols to solve security and performance problems in 5G networks. Particular attention is paid to the Twin field protocol, which can achieve a high level of security, independence and effective management of each network slice, which contributes to the improvement of the quality of service and overall network performance. The paper explores security challenges in 5G networks, particularly in the context of growing cyber threats and the need for secure data exchange. The concept of network partitioning allows creating separate logical networks with their own characteristics and security settings. The use of quantum key distribution protocols allows for a high level of data transmission protection at every stage of network deployment. The results of the study confirm that the use of the network partitioning concept and quantum key distribution protocols can effectively solve security and performance problems in 5G networks.

The emergence of quantum cryptography could give rise to breaches in quantum security in years to come with national security being affected. Delays or disruptions in the supply chain have led to an increase in the risk of supply chain theft. Personal identity theft is on the increase and as such, the role of auditors in critical infrastructures protection cannot be over- emphasized as this has become a high priority at national and EU level. This review paper examines the role of auditors in protecting critical infrastructures in Czech Republic. It adopted a study carried out by P. Lois et al.

For this purpose, after a mutual authentication performed between a user and the accessed server, a session key needs to be established among them for secure communication. In this article, we design an efficient lattice-based authenticated key exchange protocol using ring-based version of learning with errors assumption for the IoT-enabled smart devices. The proposed protocol is basically a key exchange that uses the reconciliation mechanism. The detailed security analysis under the standard model has been performed along with the informal security analysis to show that the proposed protocol is robust against different attacks. We then simulate the proposed protocol under the NS-3 simulator to measure the network performance parameters like network throughput and latency. A comparative analysis shows that the proposed protocol has superior security, less computational cost, and comparable communication cost when compered these parameters with the other competing schemes.  © 2014 IEEE.",Authentication and key agreement; Internet of Things (IoT); lattice-based cryptography; security; simulation,Cost benefit analysis; Internet of things; Internet protocols; Network security; Quantum cryptography; Security systems; Authentication and key agreements; Internet of thing; Lattice; Lattice-based; Lattice-based cryptography; Security; Security analysis; Simulation; Wireless communications; Authentication,,,,"Shor P.W., Algorithms for quantum computation: Discrete logarithms and factoring, Proc. 35th Annu.

QKD has emerged as a contender in the next generation of encryption protocols as the demand for more secure communication grows in our linked society. However, practical QKD implementations confront obstacles such as noise, interception attempts, and flaws in quantum hardware. We investigate the possibilities of Machine Learning (ML) techniques to improve the efficiency, resilience, and security of QKD protocols in this study. We provide a novel system that uses deep learning models to optimize photon polarization states and hence increase the key generation rate. Our approach detects and mitigates eavesdropping attempts using unsupervised learning algorithms, substantially enhancing the security of quantum communications. To achieve security, the BB84 protocol makes use of fundamental quantum mechanics features. Furthermore, we use reinforcement learning to adaptively alter system settings in real time to account for the quirks and noise profiles of different quantum channels. In comparison to typical QKD setups, experimental results show that our ML-enhanced QKD system is more resilient to known quantum attacks and provides a more consistent and efficient key distribution rate. Our findings indicate that the interaction of quantum physics and machine learning can pave the way for more secure and practical quantum communication networks in the near future.  © 2023 IEEE.",BB84 protocol; Machine Learning Techniques; Quantum bit error rate (QBER); Quantum Key Distribution; style,Bit error rate; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Quantum communication; Quantum theory; Reinforcement learning; BB84 protocol; Encryption protocols; Learning models; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Quantum bit error rate; Quantum physics; Quantum-key- distribution protocol; Style; Quantum cryptography,,,,"Abushgra A.A., Variations of QKD Protocols Based on Conventional System Measurements: A Literature Review, (2022); Latha R., Bommi R.M., Detection of Deauthentication Threats in Wi-Fi Channels Using Machine Learning Strategies, 2022 Int.

Physical layer secret key generation (PL-SKG), which leverages the random but common channel properties at legitimate parties, has been shown to be a secure, low-cost, and easily deployed technique as opposed to computational-based cryptography, quantum, and chaos key methods that rely on precise equipment. However, the eavesdropper (Eve) potential for current PL-SKG in fiber communications has been overlooked by most studies to date. Unlike wireless communications, where the randomness comes from the spatial multi-paths that cannot be all captured by Eves, in fiber communications, all the randomness (from transmitted random pilots or channel randomness) is contained in the signals transmitted inside the fiber. This, therefore, enables a tapping Eve to reconstruct the common features of legitimate users from its received signals, and further decrypt the featured-based secret keys. To implement this idea, we designed two Eve schemes against polarization mode distortion (PMD) based PL-SKG and the two-way cross multiplication based PL-SKG. The simulation results show that our proposed Eves can successfully reconstruct the legitimate common feature and the secret key relied upon, leading to secret key rate (SKR) reductions of between three and four orders of magnitude in the PL-SKG schemes studied. As a result, we reveal and demonstrate a novel eavesdropping potential to provide challenges for current physical layer secret key designs. We hope to provide more insightful vision and critical evaluation on the design of new physical layer secret key schemes in optical fiber links, to provide more comprehensively secure, and intelligent optical networks.  © 1983-2012 IEEE.",Eavesdropping; Fiber communications; fiber tapping; physical layer security; secret key generation,Network layers; Optical fiber communication; Optical signal processing; Polarization; Quantization (signal); Quantum cryptography; Random processes; Secure communication; Security systems; Eavesdropping; Fiber communications; Fiber tapping; Optical fiber devices; Optical fiber dispersion; Optical fiber networks; Optical fiber polarization; Physical layer security; Quantization (signal); Secret key generations; Optical fibers,,"EU Horizon 2020 MSCA, (101008280); Royal Society, (IES\R3\223068)",This work was supported in part by EU Horizon 2020 MSCA under Grant 101008280 (DIOR) and in part by UK Royal Society under Grant IES\R3\223068.,"Skorin-Kapov N., Furdek M., Zsigmond S., Wosinska L., Physicallayer security in evolving optical networks, Ieee Commun.

Such key is used to encrypt and decrypt messages for unconditionally secure communications through a classical channel. Originally, QKD protocols are designed to work between two nodes which are directly connected through a point-to-point quantum channel. Currently, commercial QKD systems have limited range and key rate. To increase key rate and extend range, the key generated by QKD at one end node is relayed hop-by-hop to the other end node through multiple trusted nodes. In a QKD network with multiple pairs of communicating nodes, routing deals with the issue of deciding for each pair, which trusted nodes are used to form a path connecting the end nodes. This paper presents an overview of QKD and highlights the differences between QKD routing as compared to classical routing. The challenges of QKD routing are presented. Existing works dealing with the challenges are surveyed. This paper ends with a discussion on remaining research issues.

In this paper, we provide an overview of the current state of research in quantum communication and quantum cryptography. We discuss the basic principles and concepts of quantum communication and cryptography, including quantum key distribution, quantum teleportation, and quantum digital signatures. We also review the various physical implementations of quantum communication systems, such as fiber-optic and free-space links, and their applications in practical scenarios, such as secure financial transactions and military communications. We analyze the security of quantum communication and cryptography protocols and compare them with classical encryption methods. We highlight the advantages of quantum communication and cryptography over traditional methods, such as its ability to provide unconditional security and its resistance to attacks from quantum computers. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Encryption; Quantum communication; Quantum cryptography; Quantum systems; Secure communication,Military applications; Network security; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Secure communication; 'current; Basic concepts; Basic principles; Data encryption; Quantum channel; Quantum digital signatures; Quantum physics; Quantum system; Quantum teleportation; State of research; Quantum communication,,,,"Nielsen M.A., Chuang I.L., Quantum Computation and Quantum Information, 10th Anniversary edn, Cambridge University Press, (2010); Gisin N., Ribordy G., Tittel W., Zbinden H., Quantum cryptography, Rev.

In this paper, in particular, we take into account terrestrial point-to-point laser communications and evaluate the performance in terms of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Bit Error Rate (BER), taking into account different scenarios, that can reflect real situations in which long distances can be reached in a secure way, guaranteeing an acceptable level of BER. So, after a huge campaign of simulations, we would like to let the scientific community know which are the theoretical limits that such kind of communications can reach. We take into account standard telescopes parameters (available today in the market), while configuring several real situations, in function of, for example, bit-rate, visibility, link distance, etc. A brief survey of the existing works is given, then a clearer performance evaluation of terrestrial FSO links is proposed. © 2023 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Multi-cloud services of quantum computing farms are currently available. One of which, IBM quantum computing, presented a road map showing their Kookaburra system with over 4158 qubits that will be available in 2025. For the standardization of Post-Quantum Cryptography or PQC, the National Institute of Standards and Technology or NIST recently announced the first candidates for standardization with one algorithm for key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), Kyber, and three algorithms for digital signatures. NIST has also issued a new call for quantum-safe digital signature algorithms due June 1, 2023. This timeline shows that FIPS-certified quantum-safe TLS protocol would take a predictably long time. However, 'steal now, crack later' tactic requires protecting data against future quantum threat actors today. NIST recommended the use of a hybrid mode of TLS 1.3 with its extensions to support PQC. The hybrid mode works for certain cases but FIPS certification for the hybridized cryptomodule might still be required. This paper proposes to take a nested mode to enable TLS 1.3 protocol with quantum-safe data, which can be made available today and is FIPS compliant. We discussed the performance impacts of the handshaking phase of the nested TLS 1.3 with PQC and the symmetric encryption phase. The major impact on performance using the nested mode is in the data symmetric encryption with AES. To overcome this performance reduction, we suggest using quantum encryption with a quantum permutation pad for data encryption with a minor performance reduction of less than 10%.  © 2023 IEEE.",FIPS;

However, significant efforts are lacking on developing practical quantum networks for power grids. This paper establishes a quantum network-based power grid (QNetGrid) framework and develops a real-time, reliable, flexible, programmable, and cost-effective QNetGrid software testbed containing repeater-based quantum communication, quantum routing, real software-defined networking (SDN) switches, and real-time networked microgrids (NMs) operations. It makes the following contributions: 1) a repeater and routing based quantum network simulator (QNSim) is developed, 2) repeaters with and without quantum memories are respectively simulated in QNSim, 3) different routing scenarios in QNetGrid are investigated, 4) a real-time QNetGrid software testbed is built in RTDS incorporating QNSim and real SDN switches, and 5) various test cases are designed, and experimental results produced with the QNetGrid testbed provide valuable insights for building quantum networks in power grids. © 1969-2012 IEEE.",Networked microgrids; quantum communication; quantum network; real-time simulator; real-time testbed,Cost effectiveness; Electric power transmission networks; Network routing; Software testing; Time switches; Microgrid; Network-based; Networked microgrid; Power grids; Quantum network; Real - Time system; Real-time simulator; Real-time testbeds; Routings; Real time systems,,,,"Ericsson G.N., Cyber security and power system communicationessential parts of a smart grid infrastructure, IEEE Trans.
